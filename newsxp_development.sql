(234, '\nAt a Porous Border, Vigilant People Prevent Spread of Ebola\n', '\nWhen Liberia reopened its borders earlier this year after the Ebola outbreak came under control, many people thought it was premature, with the virus still rife in Sierra Leone and Guinea. The border is porous and hard to control under the best of times. Until last year, the long stretches of open border were not an issue. People here have family on both sides of the border and often crisscrossed it. Then, Ebola swept through, killing more than 10,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in a year. Now with Liberia closing in on a zero infection rate, some people worry that informal border crossing here is risky because Ebola is still a problem in Guinea.   The Liberian government just does not have the capacity to monitor the entire frontier, said Nimba County Inspector Reginald Mehn. “Even you can bring all the army in Liberia here at that border line, cannot stop somebody from the Liberian side crossing to go to Guinea because they eat together, they do everything in common. They speak the same accent,” Mehn said. The government has relied on international help to educate Liberians. With funds from USAID, the American aid organization Mercy Corps created a network of about 70 local groups that raise awareness across Liberia. Because they enlisted Liberians, organizers say people were more likely to trust the message.  Jzohn Alexander Nyahn, executive director of CHESS, the local organization that took the lead here in the town of Wipah, said working with the community is the best way to fight Ebola.   “I personally don’t believe if we should close the border, it’s going to stop the spread of Ebola,” he said. People have to get to markets and health facilities. “And when they travel, you don’t know the person as a Guinean. They speak the same dialect we speak in Nimba.”  Young Liberians from within and outside Wipah inform residents about Ebola every day. They go door to door, answer questions, dispel concerns and organize a group discussion once a month.  And it seems to be working.  A few weeks ago, a woman suffering from cancer sought help from a traditional healer in Guinea. When she returned across the border, she died. Alarmed Wipah residents called the authorities in case she had contracted Ebola - vigilance they hope will keep the deadly virus at bay here until the Ebola threat in Guinea is no more.\n', 'Tue, 07 Apr 2015 00:22:54 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/at-porous-border-vigilant-people-prevent-ebola-spreading/2709404.html\n'),
(235, '\nReport Reveals Flaws in Rwanda Genocide Intervention\n', '\nFlawed decision making by the international community failed to contain the horrific 1994 genocide in Rwanda, a new report found. The findings were released Monday to coincide with the 21st anniversary of the start of the genocide and stem from a multi-national conference last year at The Hague. The conference was sponsored by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and The Hague Institute for Global Justice. Former peacekeepers, peacemakers and monitors from more than a dozen countries were gathered to analyze the events and international response in order to "shed light on modern day challenges."  The report, based on a 230-page transcript of the two-day conference, found several points of concern in how the international system functions. Some of the findings include:     The negotiation and implementation phases of the peace accords reached in Arusha, Tanzania were out of sync with each other.     Ordinary Rwandans were poorly informed of the peace process taking place in Arusha.     Western governments failed to develop a common policy on Rwanda that could have prevented the genocide.     The international community staked everything on the success of the Arusha peace agreement and failed to develop a backup plan. The conference on Rwanda was the first stage in a broader effort to examine international decision making in the event of genocide. Conference organizers said that later this year a second conference will be held at The Hague to study the fall of United Nations "safe areas" in Srebrenica during the Bosnian war. The failure by U.N. peacekeepers to protect the besieged enclave of Srebrenica in northeastern Bosnia led to the massacre of more than 8,000 men and boys in 1995.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 20:55:11 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/report-reveals-flaws-in-rwanda-genocide-intervention/2709317.html\n');

(236, '\nOpposition, Rights Group Demand Investigation into Congo Mass Burial\n', '\nA rights group and an opposition lawmaker called on Monday on the government of Democratic Republic of Congo to investigate the late night burial of at least 421 bodies last month. The government said on Friday that local authorities had buried the corpses overnight on March 19 in the rural commune of Maluku, saying they were dead fetuses and still-born babies as well as unclaimed corpses. But U.S.-based Human Rights Watch suspects the bodies might belong to people killed in anti-government protests in January or a crackdown on Kinshasa criminals. At least 40 people died in the violent protests against a proposed law to require a national census before an election - a move that opponents said was an attempt to delay the vote and extend President Joseph Kabila''s mandate. Ida Sawyer, senior researcher for HRW in Congo, said bodies went missing both during the protests as well as in an anti-gang operation in late 2013 and early 2014, in which the group says at least 51 people were killed. "Further investigations are required to determine if the bodies of those killed in January are among those buried in Maluku," she said. The political climate in Congo is tense ahead of the presidential election scheduled for late next year when Kabila''s mandate is set to expire. A parliamentarian with the opposition Engagement for Citizenship and Development (ECIDE) party asked for the bodies to be exhumed and for autopsies to be conducted. "Why bury these people at night? There needs to be an inquiry. This is not a simple affair," Martin Fayulu, told Reuters on Monday. Human rights workers first became aware of the burial site after residents of Maluku reported a smell and tire tracks near the local cemetery more than two weeks ago. "The women who work the fields there noticed a foul odor. They discovered the leg of a body," said Dolly Idefo, executive director of Voice for the Voiceless, a Kinshasa-based human rights organization. There was nothing to mark the burial site, Idefo added. The government says the bodies were buried individually and not in a mass grave. Congo''s justice minister, Alexis Thambwe, said on Friday the government was prepared to exhume all the corpses should anyone raise the "slightest doubt" about the circumstances of their deaths. But government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Monday there would be no exhumations, saying that human rights bodies or government officials had no right to make such a request.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 18:45:16 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/rights-group-demands-investigation-into-congo-mass-burial/2709284.html\n'),
(237, 'Somali President: Kenya Should Not Build Wall', '\nSomalia''s president is urging Kenya to avoid drastic measures as it tries to stop cross-border attacks by al-Shabab. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud spoke exclusively to VOA Somali on Sunday, three days after al-Shabab gunmen massacred scores of students at Kenya''s Garissa University College. Mohamud objected to calls by some Kenyan politicians to deport all Somali refugees or to build a wall along the Kenyan-Somali border. He rejected accusations the refugees, who mostly live in the Dadaab refugee camps, are responsible for insecurity in Kenya. "That is not true, and whoever said that does not understand al-Shabab''s culture," said Mohamud. "One of the gunmen [was] identified as the son of a Kenyan official and that is an example; he is not from the refugee camp nor Somalia.  I do not believe there is a connection between Somali refugees living in Dadaab camps and terrorism activities." The Somali president also said building a wall along the 680-kilometer-long border would be pointless. "We are fighting against an ideology, not fighters or soldiers that have bases," he said.  "A separation wall can not stop an ideology.  The Kenyan government has not officially notified us about the plan, but if they do, we will share with them about our experience about that.  We do not believe a wall can stop al-Shabab hostility." The president expressed sadness at last Thursday''s attack, in which al-Shabab gunmen stormed the Garissa campus and shot dead nearly 150 students before being killed by security forces. The al-Qaida linked militant group said the attack was retaliation for the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia.  Mohamed rejected that assertion, calling it "propaganda."  He said the Kenyan people and their leaders stand together in support of Somalia, and that Somalia appreciates that support. Asked if his government is ready to hold talks with al-Shabab, the Somali president said his government has offered amnesty to militants.  He said many fighters and leaders accepted that offer, adding that his government will continue to talk to anyone in al-Shabab who is willing to denounce violence.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 14:37:17 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/somali-president-kenya-should-not-build-wall/2708740.html\n'),

The group''s six-year insurgency, and President Goodluck Jonathan''s failure to end it or protect civilians, were factors in the victory of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari in last week''s election. The group fighting for an Islamic state has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds, although a military operation against them by Nigeria and neighbors Chad, Cameroon and Niger in the past two months has wrested back much of the territory it controlled.

(239, '\nSouth Africa Mulls Mixed Legacy of Cecil John Rhodes\n', '\nOnly a figure as intriguing as Cecil John Rhodes could still manage to stir controversy more than a century after his death. The British industrialist and colonialist is under fire in 2015 by young South Africans, who say his image is unfairly glorified and needs to be scrubbed from institutions like the venerable University of Cape Town. The nation''s ruling party agrees, though for the moment Rhodes'' legacy remains part of the educational landscape. Judging from his own words, Cecil John Rhodes would have a hard time in today’s multicultural South Africa. The British-born mining magnate, industrialist and politician came to the African continent as a teen in the 1870s, and had this to say about his adopted home: “Africa is still lying ready for us,” he wrote in 1877. “It is our duty to take it. It is our duty to seize every opportunity of acquiring more territory and we should keep this one idea steadily before our eyes: that more territory simply means more of the Anglo-Saxon race: more of the best the most human, most honorable race the world possesses.” It is for pronouncements like that that students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa''s top academic institution that was built on land donated by Rhodes, want his image removed.  In the past month, students have pelted his prominent statue with excrement, amid claims he is the very embodiment of “white arrogance.” Late last month, the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue from campus to an undecided location.  The move has also prompted discussion at South Africa’s Rhodes University, which is considering changing its name. The ruling African National Congress, which has dominated South African politics since the end of apartheid in 1994, has also given its support to the student movement. “Rhodes’s name is synonymous with the darkest era of our country’s history, in which black people were subjected to a murderous, unjust, inhumane, criminal and oppressive system on the basis of the color of their skin,” the ANC said in a statement.  “… Having monuments glorifying the legacy of such individuals who embody such an evil system, particularly at a university, which is still struggling with racial transformation more 20 years into democracy, undermines our on-going endeavour for national reconciliation and unity.” Rhodes may be dead, but the protesters say the problem is that his legacy of white supremacy is alive and well in the Rainbow Nation.  For example, they say, UCT’s academic staff is overwhelmingly white, and there still exist deep divisions between black and white students. South Africa, wrote UCT Constitutional law professor Pierre De Vos, is “entangled with the past because everything all of us assumed, everything we believed, everything drummed into our collective consciousness over 350 years of colonial conquest and racial domination did not evaporate into thin air in 1994.” The nation may have ended the racist apartheid system that year, but economic inequality has not kept pace with that social transformation.  For example, the last census found the average white family earns six times more than the average black family.  In a country where just less than 80 percent of the population is black, nine out of 10 South Africans below the poverty line are black. That’s why some South Africans on both sides of the issue argue the Rhodes statue is simply a symbol. “The statue is a symbolic form of discrimination and if it stays, UCT will remain untransformed,” UCT researcher Zethu Matebeni argued in local media.  “It contributes to the institutional culture that makes UCT untransformed.” But the federal chairman of the opposition Democratic Alliance, Wilmot James, argued in a statement the university should acknowledge its history by keeping the statue. “Why not build a statue of another figure that engages Rhodes in perpetual conversation?” he wrote. “This would symbolize the dialogue and reflection that must happen in each generation, not in the absence of the past, but precisely because of it.  Righteousness is not the sole preserve of some; neither is morality the possession of the victors or rulers of the day.” He also voiced a rare note of support for Rhodes, who founded the well-known Rhodes Scholarship at the University of Oxford, a program enjoyed by many African luminaries and former U.S. president Bill Clinton. "Cecil John Rhodes did awful things as part of his colonial project.  But through forward thinking by later generations good was able to come, specifically in the area of education," he said. What would Rhodes think of his rejection by modern South Africans? One wonders if he would care; after all, this is the man who famously said, “Remember that you are an Englishman, and have consequently won first prize in the lottery of life." Do you think the University of Cape Town should remove the statue of Cecil John Rhodes?

Sjaak Rijke, a train conductor who was kidnapped in Timbuktu in November 2011, was freed in a pre-dawn raid and has been transferred "safe and sound" to a temporary base in Tessalit, in northeast Mali. His wife had escaped armed gunmen, who took three captives. French forces killed two militants and captured two others in the operation, said Lieutenant Colonel Michel Sabatier, a spokesman for Barkhane, the French counter-insurgency operation in the region. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Rijke was in good condition considering the circumstances and receiving medical treatment under Dutch supervision. He said he would soon be reunited with his family. In his hometown, Woerden, relieved residents were flying the Dutch flag to mark his release. "The liberation of Mr. Rijke underscores France''s staunch determination to fight armed terrorist groups in the Sahel region as part of the Barkhane operation," the French ministry said in a statement. "The Netherlands has continuously worked in recent years to bring this hostage-taking to an end," a government statement said. "This is fantastic news for Sjaak and his family." In November, Rijke''s captors, the North African al-Qaida-affiliated group AQIM, issued a video of him along with French national Serge Lazarevic, in which they asked for help from their leaders. Lazarevic, held captive in the Sahara for three years, was released the following month in exchange for four Islamist militants with ties to al Qaeda in north Africa. France intervened against al-Qaida-linked militants in its former colony of Mali in January 2013. It has since created Barkhane, a 3,000-strong force to track down Islamist militants across a band of the Sahara desert stretching across five countries from Chad in the east to Mauritania in the west.

The Kenya Defense Forces said the airstrikes Sunday targeted two al-Shabab camps in the Gedo region of southern Somalia. Kenya Defense Forces spokesman David Obonyo said Monday the two camps were destroyed, though he did not give a death toll. A resident of the Gandon Dhawe area told VOA that the airstrikes killed livestock and destroyed houses, but said residents "have not seen any human casualties." Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had vowed to respond to al-Shabab''s attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya. Dozens of survivors are recovering from gunshot wounds inflicted by the militants during their 15-hour assault. Al-Shabab has carried out multiple attacks in Kenya in recent years, and warned that more would come unless Kenya withdraws troops who are part of an African Union force fighting the militants in Somalia. Kenya''s Interior Ministry said Abdirahim Abdullahi, one of four attackers killed during Thursday''s assault, is the son of a Kenyan government official. Kenya is observing a three-day mourning period that began Sunday. Somalia president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told VOA Somali Service on Sunday that Somalia-based al-Shabab was a regional enemy that needed to be confronted. He said al-Shabab’s aim to target mostly Christians in Kenya was intended to separate Muslims and Christians, but objective has failed as Kenyans understood the militants’ tactics. President Mohamud said al-Shabab "has no dignity” and could only attack "vulnerable targets." He told VOA there was nowhere in Islam that said “kill non-Muslims."

Most of the food producers are now relocating to safer areas away from the border.   Midjiyawa Bakari, Governor of the region of the far North, said the armed insurgents carry out raids in groups of 5 to10 - seizing cattle, food and money from residents along Cameroon''s border with Nigeria''s Borno state.   He said the very long and porous border with Nigeria makes it possible for the insurgents to attack crop farmers, cattle ranchers and small businesses and quickly make a getaway.   Sali Dairou, a member of the National Assembly from northern Cameroon, told VOA some of the farmers who refuse to cooperate with the assailants have been killed.   But the governor said the inability of Boko Haram to organize a major attack on Cameroon for more than two months now is an indication they are finding it very difficult to regroup themselves in Nigeria due to the offensives carried out by the new regional military force with troops from Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria.   He said he is very sure Boko Haram will be terminated soon and that today, everyone can see that the end of the terrorist group is near.   The last major attack by Boko Haram on Cameroonian territory was on January 10, 2015 at Fotokol - when about 300 assailants killed 500 people.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 06:44:13 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/boko-haram-insurgents-attacking-cameroon-for-supplies/2708164.html\n'),
(243, 'President Obama Urges Peaceful DRC Elections', '\nAn opposition leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo has called on President Joseph Kabila to categorically state that he will not seek a third term because the constitution prohibits him to seek another term.   Martin Fayulu of the Commitment for Citizenship and Development party said the opposition also wants presidential election before local government elections. This comes after President Barack Obama last week telephoned President Kabila and “emphasized the importance of timely, credible, and peaceful elections that respect the DRC’s constitution”.  A release from the White House said Obama “noted that President Kabila’s legacy as a leader who brought the DRC out of war and set it on a path of continued democratic progress would be consolidated by free and fair elections in 2016.” Kabila has not said whether or not he’s going to seek a third term. But Fayulu said the opposition welcomes President Obama’s phone call because Kabila has been laying the groundwork for a third term. “We as the opposition, we really appreciate what President Obama did. We think that according to what is going on elsewhere in Africa, mainly the example of Nigeria where President Goodluck Jonathan has organized election and things went smoothly, we think President Obama told Mr. Kabila to respect the constitution and we agree,” he said. Fayulu said the opposition wants the election timetable as announced by elections commission changed to have presidential and parliamentary elections before local government elections. “The timetable that was issued by the electoral commission is not comprehensive because it’s overbooked. And also the budget is too high – $1.1 billion. What we are saying, according to the time we have now, we cannot organize in the same day the local election, municipal election and the urban election, plus the provincial,” Fayulu said. He said the opposition wants would prefer to have provincial elections in 2015 followed by presidential and legislative elections in 2016. DRC government spokesman Lambert Mende said those calling on President Kabila to not run are jumping ahead of themselves because Kabila had said he will respect the constitution. Fayulu said Kabila is playing tricks on the Congolese people. “We want him to say that I will not contest. But some of his people are telling him to run. That’s why President Obama is telling him to respect the constitution, and we agree,” he said. He said other signals which indicate that President Kabila wants to stay in power include his recent attempt to change the electoral law so that the presidential election would be conditioned by the holding of a census. Fayulu also notes that early this year, the ruling majority in the Congolese senate agreed to remove articles in a proposed law that required completion of a vast census before 2016 election. The White House said President Obama assured President Kabila that the “United States would r3emain engaged in the DRC throughout the electoral process, including through the appointment of a new U.S. Special Envoy to the African Great Lakes  Region and the DRC.” The White House also said the two leaders reaffirmed their share commitment to ending the threat of armed groups, particularly the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:30:33 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/president-obama-urges-peaceful-drc-elections-that-respect-the-constitution/2708085.html\n'),

(246, '\nVOA Exclusive: Somali President Says Al-Shabab Must be Confronted\n', '\nSomalia''s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says the Somalia-based al-Shabab militant group is a regional enemy that needs to be confronted. He was speaking exclusively to VOA Somali, three days after al-Shabab gunmen stormed and massacred 148 people at Garissa University in northeastern Kenya. The president expressed horror and sadness at the Garissa attack. He said al-Shabab’s aim to target mostly Christians in Kenya is to separate Muslims and Christians in that country, but he said that objective has failed because Kenyans understand the militants’ tactics. ''No dignity'' The president said he spoke with Kenyan leaders and urged Kenyans to unite and confront al-Shabab militants. President Mohamud said the group is an “enemy that has no dignity.” “They kill Somalis and their leaders,” and there is nowhere in Islam that says “kill non-Muslims.” Asked why terror attacks on Kenyan soil have increased recently, and whether Kenya has learned any lessons from previous attacks, the president said al-Shabab can’t target military and government institutions, but now only targets vulnerable areas because it’s easy for them. He said this tactic shows that they are in a desperate mood and are coming to an end. Some political leaders in Kenya have urged the repatriation of Somali refugees from the Dadab camp in the wake of last week''s attack, accusing them of being responsible for the insecurity in Kenya. The Somali president rejected that allegation, saying “there is no connection between refugee camps and terrorism activities.” He said one refugee can join the group, but that the majority of the Somali refugees are peace-loving people who reject al-Shabab militants. Amnesty offer Asked about Kenya’s plan to build a wall along the border to keep out al-Shabab attacks, the president said he heard it from the media, but he said a wall will not stop al-Shabab’s “hostility.” He said we are fighting an “ideology, not fighters,” so a separation barrier can’t solve the problem. Al-Shabab militants claim their attack on Kenya was revenge for Kenya’s involvement in Somalia, and they call on Kenya to withdraw from Somalia. But the Somali president rejected that assertion and said, “It’s a propaganda.” He said the Kenyan people and their leaders stand together in support of Somalia, and that Somalia appreciates that support. Finally, asked if his government is ready to talk to al-Shabab to resolve the problem, he said his government has offered an amnesty to al-Shabab militants. He said many fighters and leaders accepted that offer and the government has welcomed them, but he said his government will continue to talk to anyone in the al-Shabab group who is willing to denounce violence.\n', 'Sun, 05 Apr 2015 16:27:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/somali-president-says-regional-enemy-al-shabab-must-be-confrontred/2707721.html\n'),
(247, '\nPicking Up the Pieces in Garissa After Terror Attack\n', '\nVictims of the devastating terrorist attack that left 148 people dead last week in Garissa, Kenya, are trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. The Kenyan military is keeping a tight grip on the town of Garissa after the April 2 terror attack. Garissa county is under a night-time curfew, along with three other counties frequently threatened by al-Shabab. Garissa has seen sporadic bomb and grenade attacks in recent years, blamed on the Somali militants. But nothing of this magnitude. At Garissa hospital, student survivors recount gruesome stories of a day of horror. One student, Quintin Anyango, said she was just getting up for an early study session when the attack began. “When I moved out, I saw other three strange people with their guns, I stood for a moment, then from there I decided not to go back to the hostel, but to look for somewhere, where I could hide safely," she said. She said she hid the entire day, listening to the gunshots as her classmates were executed in a nearby lecture hall. Anyango said she would go back to school some day but just not here. “If it is Garissa, I don’t see me coming back. If it is anywhere, apart from Garissa, I will continue with my education,” Anyango said. Al-Shabab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya’s mistreatment of Muslims, as well as its role in Somalia. ?But Muslim residents have been quick to condemn the terrorist group. Some local leaders have even called for Somali refugees living nearby to be sent back. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in an address to the nation Saturday said terrorists were plotting their attacks from within Kenya, and promised a swift crackdown on those responsible. “We will not allow them to continue their lives as normal. The full force of the law will be brought to bear with even greater intensity than has been the case in previous years,” Kenyatta said. Meantime, victims of the attack are still looking for answers. At an accounting center in Garissa, workers keep track of which students - out of more than 800 at Garissa University College - have been identified, dead or alive. David Muciri, an instructor at another nearby college, has been poring through the lists and fielding calls from the worried parents of students still missing. “It’s traumatizing, I must say it is, even us as the neighbors of the university we are really feeling touched because we don’t know what will happen to us, maybe we are next, we don’t know,” Muciri said. The trauma of the attack will resonate in Garissa and towns across Kenya for a some time.

(248, '\nAl-Shabab Gunman Identified as Son of Kenyan Official\n', '\nThe son of a Kenyan government official was one of the masked al-Shabab gunmen who massacred 148 people at Garissa University College. Kenya''s Interior Ministry said Abdirahim Abdullahi was among four attackers killed Thursday during the attack.  A spokesman said the government official had earlier reported his son missing. The news came as Kenyans dedicated Easter Sunday services to the massacre victims and Pope Francis prayed for those killed by Islamist gunmen who hunted down Christians while sparing Muslims. Many churches in Kenya hired armed guards to protect their Easter congregations.  The country also began a three day mourning period. Somalia president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told VOA Somali Service on Sunday that Somalia-based al-Shabab is a regional enemy that needs to be confronted.   He says al-Shabab’s aim to target mostly Christians in Kenya is intended to separate Muslims and Christians, but he says that objective has failed as Kenyans understand the militants’ tactics. President Mohamud says al-Shabab "has no dignity” and can only attack "vulnerable targets."    He told VOA there is nowhere in Islam that says“kill non-Muslims." For the several hundred members of Garissa''s Christian minority, which is fearful following the attack by the al-Shabab militants, Sunday''s service was laden with emotion. The gunmen who attacked Garissa University College on Thursday singled out Christians for killing, though al-Shabab has a long record of killing Muslims over the years. "We just keep on praying that God can help us, to comfort us in this difficult time," said Dominick Odhiambo, a worshipper who said he planned to abandon his job as a plumber in Garissa and leave for his hometown because he was afraid. In Garissa, where masked gunmen in 2012 killed more than a dozen people in simultaneous gun and grenade raids on two churches, six soldiers guarded the town''s main Christian church and about 100 worshippers ahead of Sunday mass. "Thank you for coming, so many of you," Bishop Joseph Alessandro said to the congregation at Our Lady of Consolation Church. He said some of those who died in Thursday''s attack would have been at the service, and he read condolence messages from around the world. VOA''s Gabe Joselow reports   ''Nowhere is safe'' "Nowhere is safe, but here at church you can be with God and console yourself," said Meli Muasya at Garissa''s walled Catholic Church. In Mombasa, "we are very concerned about the security of our churches and worshippers, especially this Easter period, and also because it is clear that these attackers are targeting Christians," Willybard Lagho, a Mombasa-based Catholic priest and chairman of the Coast Interfaith Council of Clerics (CICC), told Reuters. Lagho said churches in the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa were hiring armed police and private security guards for mass on Easter Sunday. Christians make up 83 percent of Kenya''s 44 million population. During a televised address Saturday, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared a three-day mourning period to begin Sunday, appealing to Kenyans to safeguard the nation''s "peace and stability." Kenyatta stressed his belief that "Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance." He said “the radicalization that breeds terrorism” is conducted “in the full glare of day.” Criticism of special forces Also Sunday, Kenya''s security chief defended the response by special forces to the attacks.   The French news agency AFP reported that it took at least seven hours for special forces to arrive at the scene of the massacre after flying from the capital, Nairobi, hours after other security personnel fought with the militants. Some journalists who drove the same 365-kilometer distance are reported to have arrived before the special forces. Several Kenyan newspapers on Sunday were strongly critical of the government''s response. "This is negligence on a scale that borders on the criminal," the Nation wrote in its editorial on Sunday, recalling how survivors said "the gunmen, who killed scores of students with obvious relish, took their time." Interior Minster Joseph Nkaissery has said the attack was "one of those incidents which can surprise any country," while President Kenyatta paid his tribute to the three police and three soldiers killed, who paid "the ultimate price in their selfless service to Kenya." But newspapers on Sunday were deeply critical of the government response. But Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the response, telling AFP on Saturday that "fighting terrorism ... is like being a goalkeeper. You have 100 saves, and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you." Interior spokesman Njoka also dismissed the criticism. "If you look at how we responded it was not bad at all, say, compared to Westgate," Njoka told the Nation. "It takes time to assess and make the decisions, escalating it from National Security Advisory Committee to the National Security Council and then to scramble the elite units, get them to the airport and fly them to Garissa which is a two hour flight. There were many moving parts," he added. Four masked militants from the Somali Islamist group stormed the university campus in Garissa on Thursday, seeking out Christian students to kill while sparing some Muslims. Revenge attack Al-Shabab group said the assault on Garissa, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the Somali border, was revenge for Kenya sending troops into Somalia to fight alongside African Union peacekeepers against the al Qaeda-aligned group. The militants have threatened to turn Kenyan cities "red with blood" with more attacks. Police have stepped up security at shopping malls and public buildings in the capital Nairobi, and in the eastern coastal region which has been prone to al Shabaab attacks. Kenya has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in four counties along its 700-kilometer (420-mile) border with Somalia and deployed helicopters along its palm-fringed coast, popular with Western tourists and the scene of Islamist attacks in the past. Coastal Region police chief Robert Kitur told Reuters extra uniformed and plain-clothes police officers had been deployed. "What happened in Garissa must never be seen in Mombasa or anywhere else in the region and country," he said. Late on Saturday, 613 students and 50 staff from Garissa University College arrived in Nairobi to an emotional welcome by parents and relatives. Parents of missing students attempted to identify bodies at the city''s mortuary.

A 9-month-old boy tested positive for Ebola after dying in Kailahun, the district on Guinea''s border that recorded Sierra Leone''s first Ebola case last May and was for months the epicenter of the crisis. Kailahun went from recording up to 80 infections per week in June to zero cases at the end of last year. Nearly 3,800 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, but numbers of weekly cases are falling as steps to control the disease take hold. However, Winnie Romeril, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said local and foreign experts had been dispatched to investigate the case after the positive test result. Kenema and Kono, two other eastern districts, have recorded a handful of cases in recent months, but Kailahun''s successes had been cited as examples for other areas to follow. Alex Bonapha, the Kailahun district council chairman, said it was not clear how the boy may have contracted Ebola. Both his parents are healthy. Bonapha said the boy might have gotten the disease during a blood transfusion, or there might have been a problem with the sample that was tested. Sources at the Nixon Hospital in Kailahun district confirmed that the boy had undergone a blood transfusion before dying. "I am aware of the weakness in the health system, which means that the blood transfused into the baby could well not have been the blood that had been donated by his uncle,'''' Bonapha said. A health ministry official expressed serious concern over the case, which came as the focus of local and international health officials is on the north and west of the country, the latest areas affected by Ebola. Liberia, once the hardest hit of all the countries in West Africa, has detected no Ebola cases since the last confirmed patient died at the end of March. However, Guinea has imposed a 45-day state of emergency to tackle a spike of cases in that country, where the outbreak was first confirmed last year. As part of these measures, authorities closed all private medical clinics in Kindia, 135 kilometers (84 miles) from the capital, Conakry, after a new case of Ebola was recorded there.

(250, 'Burundi Ministers Meet Refugees in Rwanda', '\nA delegation of Burundi government ministers is meeting Saturday with Burundi refugees who have sought safe haven in neighboring Rwanda, according to VOA''s Africa Division. The refugees say they have left their homes in Burundi because they are afraid of the violence that could erupt in the run up to Burundi''s presidential elections in June. There is concern in Burundi that President Pierre Nkurunziza''s ambitions for a constitutionally-questionable third term in office could re-ignite violence in a country still regaining its footing after years of civil war. President Nkurunziza has faced revolt from within his own party over his presumed candidacy. Seventy-nine members of the ruling CNDD-FDD party wrote the president last week asking him not to seek office. The influential Catholic Church in Burundi also has joined the growing chorus of civil society and opposition groups urging Mr. Nkurunziza not to run. The president has offered no signal he will step aside. Nkurunziza''s eligibility comes down to a legal argument over the wording of a formative peace agreement and the country''s constitution. Burundi''s existing political structures were founded on the 2000 Arusha agreement which brought to an end the civil war between Hutu and Tutsi factions that killed up to 300,000 people. That agreement says the president can serve no more than two terms in office. But the 2005 constitution states the president must be elected through “universal direct suffrage” - interpreted to mean a popular vote. Nkurunziza was elected by parliament to his first term, so, his supporters argue, he is eligible to run again. Whether he does so or not, Nkurunziza''s government has been under fire from rights groups and the international community for excluding the opposition and silencing voices of dissent. Rights groups have accused the ruling party of arming its youth wing, known as the Imbonerakure, and using them to attack opponents in the past. Human Rights Watch last month said members of the group assisted the police and military in executing 47 people following a confrontation with an unnamed armed group in northwestern Cibitoke province. Jean Claude Nkundwa, a peace activist in Bujumbura, fears that armed groups could be exploited to keep the president in power. The international community, including the United Nations, the United States and the African Union have urged Burundian political actors to respect the rule of law and hold fair elections, without much weighing into the debate about whether the president has the legal authority to run. Nkundwa is urging foreign partners to be prepared to intervene if necessary. “The current situation may just break all the things that we have built for 10 years,” he says. “This is where I actually personally would call the international community to get actively engaged to protect this democratic state we have achieved.”\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 07:25:19 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/burundi-ministers-meet-refugees-in-rwanda/2706637.html\n'),
(251, '\nKenyan President Urges Unity After University Massacre\n', '\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta called for unity Saturday, two days after al-Shabab militants massacred 148 people on a university campus, targeting mostly Christians. In a televised address to the nation, Kenyatta declared a three-day mourning period, appealing to Kenyans to safeguard the nation''s "peace and stability." "I urge every Kenyan, every church and every local leader to speak up for our unity and ensure that our justified anger does not spill over and lead to the victimization of anyone," he said. "This would only play into the hands of the terrorists." Kenyatta stressed his belief that "Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance" and said “the radicalization that breeds terrorism” is conducted “in the full glare of day.” He said the government must have information and cooperation from the parents and families of those who are being radicalized, as well as from political and religious leaders, in order to effectively combat the terrorists. Thursday''s slaughter at Garissa University College was Kenya''s deadliest terrorist attack since al-Qaida''s 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. That attack killed more than 200 people, mostly Kenyans. Kenyatta promised the government would "employ all means" to bring the Islamist militants behind the university murders to justice. He said security forces were pursuing leads on the remaining accomplices and the mastermind of the attack. Kenyatta said five of the accused terrorists had been arrested, while security forces killed four. Kenyan officials said some of the suspects arrested were trying to flee to neighboring Somalia, where al-Shabab is based. Kenyans gathered Saturday to see the bodies of the dead gunmen, who Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said blew up "like bombs" when police shot them. VOA''s reporter said police put the bodies in an open truck that drove around the streets. Other families continued to learn of their losses in the attack, viewing the bodies of their loved ones in a mortuary. Threat of ''another bloodbath'' An al-Shabab statement Saturday threatened "another bloodbath" in Kenya, warning, "No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety." The group said Thursday''s attack was revenge for Kenyan military action inside Somalia. The attackers stormed the university campus before dawn Thursday and began shooting indiscriminately. Witnesses said the gunmen later targeted Christians and freed some Muslims. Kenyan security forces battled the militants for 15 hours and rescued more than 500 students before fatally shooting the attackers. A Kenyan member of parliament, Mohamed Dahiye Duale, told VOA''s Somali service that the attackers had traveled from Dadab refugee camp to Garisa in a taxi before storming the university campus. U.S. President Barack Obama, whose father was from Kenya, expressed "horror and sadness" over the attack. The White House said Obama reiterated his plans to visit Nairobi in July. The Kenyan government is offering a $220,000 reward for an al-Shabab member thought to be behind the attacks. Mohammed Mohamud Kuno is already on a government watch list. He is suspected of being al-Shabab''s chief for external operations against Kenya. The al-Qaida-linked group has battled the Somali government and its allies since 2006. It has attacked targets in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops across the border in 2011.   In 2013, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the massacre in Nairobi''s Westgate Mall that killed more than 60 people. The University of Nairobi warned its students last week that Kenyan government agencies had intelligence reports indicating al-Shabab was planning an attack on a major university, among other targets. It was not clear if a similar warning was issued in Garissa. ?Another survivor emerges The Kenyan Red Cross reported finding a female survivor of the massacre on Saturday at the college. Cynthia Charotich, 19, told The Associated Press she''d remained hidden in a closet crawl space for two days, fearing attackers might still be lurking. "I was just praying to my God," said Charotich, a Christian. Kenyatta has ordered 10,000 police recruits whose enrollments are still pending to immediately report for training at the police college. Somalia''s President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has called for greater security cooperation with Kenya, offering his condolences and calling the attack "barbaric." He said Friday that the killings showed the need to eliminate the "menace" of al-Shabab.\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 06:52:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/al-shabab-promises-another-bloodbath-in-kenya/2706626.html\n'),
(252, 'South Sudan Opposition Politician Disappears', '\nThe head of a South Sudanese opposition political party was taken from his home by unidentified men two days ago and has not been seen since, members of his People''s Liberal Party said Friday. Peter Mayen Majongdit disappeared days after he published a statement in the Juba Monitor newspaper, challenging the government to recover $4 billion that were allegedly stolen by senior politicians. Mayen, who is the interim chairman fo the People''s Liberal Party, said in the statement that the administration of President Salva Kiir should focus on recovering the missing funds rather than seeking loans from other countries. South Sudan’s parliament last week authorized the Minister of Finance to negotiate a loan worth $500 million dollars with Qatar National Bank. South Sudan says the funds are needed to close a budget gap created by the falling price of crude oil and a steep decline in domestic oil production caused by nearly 16 months of domestic conflict. The World Bank says South Sudan has the most oil-dependent economy in the world.  The head of the Youth League of the People''s Liberal Party, Mijok Lang Mijak, said Mayen had been threatened before he disappeared. Lang said Mayen''s wife called him after the Juba Monitor published his statement and told him not to go home because "there were some officials at home... and they were asking for Mayen.” Other party officials, including the secretary general, have received threatening phone calls and have gone into hiding since Mayen disappeared, Lang said. Mayen''s family has left their home, he said. The People’s Liberal Party was launched in February.

(255, '\nNew Measures to Prevent Voter Irregularities in Uganda\n', '\nThe Electoral Commission of Uganda will use a biometric system - a system that uses human body characteristics to determine identity - to update its voters register ahead of next year’s general election, says Electoral Commission spokesman Jotham Taremwa. Denying reports that the electoral commission lacks funds needed to organize the elections within the next 10 months, Taremwa says the electoral body needs about $90,000,000 to organize the elections. The government has disbursed $67,000,000 but has yet to release the rest of the funds. Some opposition politicians expressed worry that the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) could use the lack of funds to rig the election to ensure incumbent President Yoweri Museveni wins the presidential vote. Taremwa disagreed. He says he is assured that the administration in Kampala will release the rest of the funds the commission needs to organize the vote. “I am very confident that government will give us this money, and we will organize these elections. When we launched our roadmap, we requested funding in three different financial years,” said Taremwa. “So, each financial year, we outline the key activities we will be undertaking in preparation for the general election. Throughout the process and the period, government has been giving us that money, and we are hopeful government will give us the top up and we hold the elections. Nobody should get worried about no holding elections,” he added. Opposition political parties are demanding electoral reforms after accusing the electoral commission of bias and favoritism to candidates of the ruling NRM. They are also demanding a complete overhaul of the electoral register used for the elections. Taremwa denied the accusations. He says the electoral commission will implement new measures to prevent voter irregularities and possible rigging in the next election. “We are in the process of updating the voters register. So what we did was that the country recently did the enrollment of its citizens for purposes of issuances of National ID [Identification] and we started with 16 years and above and the reason was those who were 16 years and above by 2016 they would be 18 years,” said Taremwa. “So, we have corrected the biometric data from the data bank from that registration exercise. And it is that data that we have put out there to make sure that people ascertain and more so register new people who are not on the register, to get a newly updated register that reflects the exact number of the voters in the country,” he added. Taremwa says the electoral commission aims to implement the new biometric measures to prevent voter irregularities and rigging during polling. “Ugandans should be very confident... It won’t be possible for anybody to vote twice, where it won’t be easy for anybody to impersonate another voter," he said. "So, we hope to get a clean voting process because of the biometric voters register. I think Ugandans should be proud of that rather than worry.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:16:22 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-measures-to-prevent-voter-irregularities-in-uganda/2731058.html\n'),

The bodies of eight people were discovered in September in Womey, a village near the city of Nzerekore around 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of the capital Conakry. Some had been hacked to death with machetes or had their throats slit before their bodies were thrown into latrines, witnesses at the trial in Nzerekore said. “There were 26 defendants. Among them, a group consisting of 11 was sentenced to life in prison,” said prosecutor William Fernandez, who had requested the death penalty for charges including murder and conspiracy. The other 15 defendants were found innocent and released. Victims include local administrators, medical officers, journalists The victims, who had come under attack by a stone-throwing mob in Womey before their murder, included local administrators, two medical officers, a pastor and three journalists. Since the Ebola virus first appeared in the forests of Guinea over a year ago, it has killed more than 10,000 people in Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia in the worst epidemic of the disease on record.

(260, 'Political Tensions in Guinea Heating Up', '\nPolitical tensions are heating up in Guinea again — this time over the government’s decision to postpone local elections until 2016. The opposition says it will keep protesting despite renewed calls for dialogue. Guineans say they are tired of all the discord. Protesters clashed with security forces Monday during what authorities said was an unauthorized demonstration in Conakry. At least three people were wounded. An unknown number were arrested. Hundreds arrested during a demonstration last week have been sentenced to two to five month’s imprisonment. One person was killed. The opposition said security forces fired live bullets, which the government denies. It is just the latest episode in what has been a years-long stand-off between the government and the opposition over election organization. Dozens have been killed and wounded in protests since 2012. Previous disputes have centered on the composition of the electoral commission and the company contracted to handle the technical side of voter registration and vote counting. Losing patience Guineans, even those who support the opposition, say they are losing patience. Teacher Mariam Sachko says “the current situation is unfortunate.” She says “the opposition does not seem to want dialogue. They do not trust the government," she adds, "but this is not a solution and they are just being stubborn." The opposition rejected a government delegation Monday. Conakry Doctor Mamoudou Camara says "politics cannot go with violence that is what they should understand. Political extremism is not good." Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate until the government withdraws the current electoral timetable. That timetable sets the presidential poll for October and postpones local elections to 2016. Union of Republican Forces party leader Sidya Toure told VOA he believes the government wants to rig the presidential election. "This is like a war," he says. "They cannot call for ceasefire before going to the negotiating table. We cannot negotiate until the electoral commission has stopped its current preparations." The international community has previously mediated deals between the two sides. Toure says the government has not kept its promises. Election financing The electoral commission says because of the Ebola outbreak, it cannot afford to hold two elections in 2015. But the opposition argues that municipal elections are long overdue. The last ones were held in 2005. Government spokesman Albert Damantang Camara says the government''s goal is peaceful elections and it will not stop calling for dialogue. He says "when you are sincere, you can come to the table without pre-conditions." The government says it does not control the independent electoral commission or the electoral timetable. But university professor and political analyst Sori Diakite says the government and the opposition need to talk. He says it is better to go straight to the presidential elections because if the president’s elected mandate expires this year, Guinea will have an illegal president and that could provoke more problems that could be more dangerous for the country.

(262, '\nEthiopians Mourn Libya Killings at Rally, Scuffles Erupt\n', '\nTens of thousands of Ethiopians gathered as emotions ran high at a mass rally in the capital, Addis Ababa, Wednesday commemorating 30 compatriots shot and beheaded by Islamic State militants in Libya. Some demonstrators hurled stones and police fired teargas as protesters rallied in Meskel Square at dawn to denounce Islamic State. “We will not bow down to terrorism!” one placard carried by a young boy said. Another read: “The world must be united against terrorism.” The demonstration marked the start of a three-day mourning period in the East African country. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was among the officials and religious leaders who addressed the gathering. The prime minister urged Ethiopians not to travel across the Sahara to reach Europe. “We should strengthen our resolve against any form of terrorism and extremism,” he added. Although Ethiopia''s economy is growing fast, unemployment remains high. Many opt to trek across the desert via Libya, where Islamic State militants have gained a toehold after seizing large parts of Syria and Iraq. Ethiopia has confirmed that those killed in the video, posted Saturday, were its citizens. Family members and friends of the victims were given special attention during the event.  Aheza Kahesai, the mother of one the victims, said she found out her child was killed when someone else told her they had seen her son on television. Her 38-year old son left two months ago saying he had found a job as a driver overseas. One man at the government-organized rally, who said he was a university professor, said many in the crowd were angry that jobless Ethiopians still felt they had to travel to places like Libya in the hope of crossing over to a better life in Europe. He also accused the authorities of clamping down on free speech. “Even the chanting [at the rally] was led by the government,” he said. “We do not have the power to speak.” The atmosphere changed when parts of the crowd began to voice the dissatisfaction of many toward the government''s response not only to the Libya killings, but also to the lack of action to help Ethiopians caught up in the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. Authorities then dispersed the crowds, with police using sticks and firing a few rounds of tear gas to clear out the main square. Dozens were taken into custody, and some wounded demonstrators and police were taken to the hospital. Less than two hours later everything was back to normal. Ethiopia''s government dismisses accusations from rights groups that it stifles critics and opponents. But a 31-year-old student who requested anonymity had tears in his eyes as he viewed the scene Wednesday.  He said he understands people''s frustration because the Ethiopian government doesn’t allow its citizens to express their feelings.   “The first thing the government should ask is why people are migrating. There are a lot of challenges here. I want to ask the government to search what is the problem of society to get out of their countries,” he said. Ethiopia has a long history of Muslims and Christians living peacefully side-by-side, so the killings have stunned the many. Muslims make up about 40 percent of the population, according to government statistics, with followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church being the majority. Muslim lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday read out verses in the Koran preaching tolerance. “I am in pain.

Human Rights Watch reported Wednesday that the Christian anti-balaka fighters are holding at least 42 Muslim Peuhl, mostly women and children, in southwest C.A.R., and committing acts that amount to war crimes. Researcher Lewis Mudge, with HRW, said the anti-balaka fighters are sexually enslaving women and killing children, tactics he called "shocking." He said U.N. peacekeepers should now intervene to free the hostages and bring their captors to justice. The statement follows the rescue April 4-5 of a group of 13 Peuhl held hostage by anti-balaka fighters in the southwestern village of Pondo. U.N. peacekeepers said the captors killed two young boys and raped three women, one of whom became pregnant and died in childbirth. Her baby later died of malnutrition. The rescued Peuhl said that anti-balaka fighters are holding more captives in towns and villages near Pondo, where they, too, may be in danger of murder and sexual assault by their captors. Human Rights Watch said reports by the recently freed captives, witnesses and other sources indicate dozens of other Peuhl are being held, some for more than a year. The rights group called on the U.N. and government officials to "urgently intervene" to free the other Peuhl  and arrest their captors. The anti-balaka - meaning anti-sword or anti-machete - fighters have killed or targeted thousands of Muslims since 2013, when they organized to fight the Muslim Seleka rebels who seized power earlier that year.

But, the AU said authorities must do more to protect African and other foreign migrants.  AU Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma said the challenges faced by South Africa - poverty and unemployment - are challenges confronting most, if not all, countries on the continent. But, she said no circumstances can justify the attacks on foreigners. AU Deputy Chairperson Erastus Mwencha said the continental body also wants to remind South Africans not to forget the sacrifices many Africans made in the struggle to end apartheid. “First of all, as (the) African Union, and through the chairperson, we have condemned what has happened in South Africa. We hope that the government can do more particularly to protect the rest of the citizens from Africa and the rest of the world, but also to bring to justice those that perpetrated this heinous crime,” Mwencha said. Anti-immigrant violence He said the AU is hoping that those perpetrating the anti-immigrant violence are in the minority in South Africa. And, he urged South Africans not to forget their immediate history when many African nations sacrificed to end apartheid. “If you look at the liberation of South Africa from apartheid, the rest of the continent stood with the people of South Africa. And, unfortunately, maybe because we don’t stress our history a lot, this is forgotten and what we see is the memory that has elapsed,” Mwencha said. He commended those African nations whose nationals are experiencing xenophobic attacks in South Africa, but did not retaliate. Mwencha said Africa is interdependent and must now forge integration because that’s the only way the continent emerge stronger. South Africa Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced Tuesday that the government will deploy military personnel to join the police in preventing further violence. Mwencha said the African Union welcomes the government’s decision to deploy its military. But, he said the government should also arrest and bring to justice those who have committed the crimes to serve as a deterrent,” he said. He said no amount of economic concerns can justify the violence that has been taken place in South Africa. “If you look back to recent history, many countries really went to the extreme to even forego development just to fight apartheid. And so, that is part of the history we shouldn’t forget. If we all didn’t stand together, we wouldn’t be in the situation we are in today,” Mwencha said.

(267, '\nForest Stands Between Nigeria, Victory Over Boko Haram\n', '\nNigeria’s military announced last week that it was raiding the Sambisa Forest, one of the last strongholds of Islamist extremist group Boko Haram. Liberating the forest might be the hardest part of the campaign against the group. Aided by regional troops and foreign mercenaries, Nigeria’s military has managed to take back nearly all of the towns and villages controlled by Boko Haram in Nigeria’s northeast over the past few months. But one area remains mostly under their control: Sambisa, a massive expanse of forest that spreads thousands of square kilometers over several states. Boko Haram is thought to have retreated to this forest after being pushed out of cities like Gwoza and Bama. It is also thought to be where the group initially took the 219 schoolgirls kidnapped from the town of Chibok last year. Challenging mission Nigeria’s national security spokesman announced last week that the military was going to retake the forest. Analysts and villagers from Chibok say ridding the forest of the extremists will be a stiff challenge. Yan St. Pierre, an analyst with Berlin-based security firm MOSECON, says retaking Sambisa will be crucial to destroying Boko Haram. “All these operations come from there, a lot of the attacks on Bama for example," he said. "The attacks on Maiduguri, across in Nigeria, in Cameroon, a lot of it comes from Sambisa Forest. So if they’re not pushed out, all the activities, suicide bombers, militia training a lot of the stuff they’ve been able to do so far will still go on.” After last year’s kidnappings, parents from Chibok went into the forest in search of their daughters. Yakubu Nkeki was one of those parents, who went into Sambisa in search of his daughter, Maimuna Nkeki. Treacherous terrain He described a forest so thick you could not see the sky. About 48 kilometers in, villagers warned the parents that if they went farther, they would be killed by well-armed Boko Haram fighters. All the parents had for weapons were homemade guns, spears, machetes and bows and arrows. “They were ever ready to face even Nigeria army, talk less of we parents. If we pursued them, we will all be killed," he said. "Therefore let’s go back and inform the situation to the government.” St. Pierre expects the military to rely heavily on bombing in their campaign to retake the forest. The fighting will likely be fierce. “It’s an ages-old tactic. You know they go back into the forest, the forest, you know, you can’t really map out the forest properly," he said.

(268, '\nScientists to Share Real-time Genetic Data on MERS, Ebola\n', '\nGenetic sequence data on two of the deadliest yet most poorly understood viruses are to be made available to researchers worldwide in real time as scientists seek to speed up understanding of Ebola and MERS infections. The project, led by British scientists with West African and Saudi Arabian collaboration, hopes to encourage laboratories around the world to use the live data - updated as new cases emerge - to find new ways to diagnose and treat the killer diseases, and ideally, ultimately, prevent them. "The collective expertise of the world''s infectious disease experts is more powerful than any single lab, and the best way of tapping into this ... is to make data freely available as soon as possible," said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity which is funding the work. The gene sequences, already available for MERS cases and soon to come in the case of Ebola, will be posted on the website virological.org for anyone to see, access and use. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral disease which first emerged in humans in 2012 and has been spreading in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries since then. It is caused by a coronavirus and has already killed more than 430 people. An unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 10,000 people in the past year and infected more than 25,000 mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Despite the many deaths caused by Ebola and MERS, researchers still know relatively little about the viruses - including what animals might be acting as "viral reservoirs" - and scientists are battling to develop safe and effective cures or vaccines against them. Genetic changes Paul Kellam, a professor at Britain''s Sanger Institute, said mapping the gene structure, or sequencing the genome, of a virus can tell scientists a lot about how it is spreading and changing, and help in the search for better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent infections. "With more genetic surveillance we can spot things that are potential areas of concern - such as [genetic] changes that might mean our diagnostics might not work so well any more, or changes that suggest a virus is becoming able to transmit more easily," he explained in a telephone interview. Yet while this kind of data is invaluable to researchers, it is rarely shared swiftly or freely enough among them. Saudi Arabia was widely criticized at the start of the MERS outbreak for being slow to cooperate with experts around the world wanting to conduct crucial research on the disease. Kellam said Saudi authorities are now committed to sharing viral data widely and immediately, keen to enlist the help of international scientists in controlling MERS. As part of the same gene sequencing project, Ian Goodfellow from the University of Cambridge is in Sierra Leone working with the government there to make similar data on the Ebola virus available on virological.org as soon as possible. He plans to collect samples from Ebola patients, sequence them in a matter of hours and process the data to make the viral genome sequences in weeks - a process that could take months if samples were to be bought back to Britain for analysis.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 13:38:05 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-scientists-to-share-real-time-genetic-data-on-mers-ebola/2729018.html\n'),
(269, '\nSudan Seeks Answers After Medical Students Join Islamic State\n', '\nIn March, a group of British-Sudanese medical students abandoned their studies in Khartoum and took off in secret to join the Islamic State militant group in Syria. The school is now re-examining what went wrong and what can be done to prevent radicalization on campus. The group of four medical students and five companions started their journey to jihad at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum.   The prestigious institution, set on a breezy, tree-covered campus in the center of the city, hosts 4,000 students, many from abroad, and has no reputation for religious extremism. Student recruitment For Ahmed Babaker, dean of students at the university, it remains a bit of a mystery how this group of current and former students was drawn to Islamic State.   “The kids are very, very smart kids; very polite, very young, most of them have British passports. And we, from our side, we learn from this lesson at the university. We’d like to know how these students were recruited, how they were influenced in the campus,” said Babaker.   Signs of the students'' changing views began about two years ago, according to a friend of three women in the group.   The friend, who declined to give his name, said he noticed the women were dressing more conservatively and had stopped shaking hands when greeting men. They also began preaching, urging other Muslim women to become more religious.   An Islamic Civilization Society also began operating on the campus. The women''s friend and other acquaintances say the society was hosting speakers with extremist views.   Babaker acknowledged that in previous years, some radical sheikhs were known to have given talks at the university.   “Some of them started in campus, but usually it is the policy of my office to send some of my assistants to follow what these sheikhs are saying, so that if they deviating from some talks or propagating some jihadist ideas we can stop them, and this is what we did in the last two years,” he said. Islamic Civilization Society   Babaker said the Islamic Civilization Society continues to operate on campus, but the university now keeps a closer eye on its activities.   The students who left to join Islamic State are believed to have gone to Syria to work as medics, and not necessarily to fight for the extremist group.     The university says it is working together with the students'' families, trying to get them to return to Khartoum.   “Definitely we feel very sorry for them. We think they have been cheated, they have been brainwashed, they have been influenced heavily because they were very young. They are very innocent. They are coming with very little background of Islamic culture because they have been brought [up] in the West,” said Babaker.   The Islamist group has recruited thousands of foreign fighters in its battle to establish a caliphate to rule Iraq and Syria by religious decrees and laws.

Other countries included on the list are Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, Iran, China, Burma and Cuba. According to a CPJ release, the list was compiled “based on research into the use of tactics ranging from imprisonment and repressive laws to harassment of journalists and restrictions on Internet access.”   According to CPJ, Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki created “a media climate so oppressive that even reporters for state-run news outlets live in constant fear of arrest.” Many journalists have left the country, which currently has at least 23 journalists in jail, according to the CPJ.   Furthermore, the CPJ said Eritrea has restricted Internet access to the point that fewer than 1 percent of the population can access online information.   The country also has the lowest cell phone penetration in the world, with 5.6 percent of Eritreans owning a cell phone.   North Korea While North Korea ostensibly calls for press freedom in its constitution, information is very tightly controlled.   “Nearly all the content of North Korea’s 12 main newspapers, 20 periodicals, and broadcasters comes from the official Korean Central News Agency,” according to the CPJ.   Internet access is reserved for a few elites, and even then it is tightly controlled.Average North Koreans are reliant on bootlegged TV and radio broadcasts and DVDs smuggled from China.   The CPJ estimates that 9.7 percent of the population has a cell phone, a number it says excludes phones smuggled from China.   In what the CPJ calls North Koreas press freedom “lowlight,” North Korea’s lead Kim Jong Un had his uncle removed from state media videos.Kim had his uncle executed for being “counter-revolutionary.”   “The tactics used by Eritrea and North Korea are mirrored to varying degrees in other heavily censored countries,” according to the CPJ. “To keep their grip on power, repressive regimes use a combination of media monopoly, harassment, spying, threats of journalist imprisonment, and restriction of journalists’ entry into or movements within their countries.” The CPJ said throwing journalists in jail is the “most effective form of intimidation and harassment used against journalists.”   Other offenders Eritrea, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, Iran, China, and Burma are “among the top 10 worst jailers of journalists worldwide, according to CPJ’s annual prison census.”   The most common charge levied against journalists was “anti-state crimes,” the CPJ said.   China, for example, has 44 journalists imprisoned with 29 charged with anti-state crimes. The CPJ called China the “world’s worst jailer,” and ranked it the eighth most censored country.   Countries which nearly made the CPJ list included Belarus, Equatorial Guinea, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, all of which the CPJ said “have little to no independent media and are so tightly closed that it can be difficult even to get information about conditions for journalists.”\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:36:57 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/eritrea-north-korea-most-censored-countries-committee-to-protect-journalists/2728636.html\n'),
(271, 'CPJ Names 10 Most Repressive Nations for Media', '\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists has listed the 10 countries  where the news media are the most restricted. Led by Eritrea and North Korea, the CPJ report released Tuesday says that these countries harass and imprison journalists, as well as censor the Internet to keep reporters quiet. The report names China as the world''s leading jailer, with 44 journalists behind bars. And the CPJ cites Iran as using mass and arbitrary detention to silence dissent or force exile. Dangerous times   With 200 journalists worldwide jailed this year alone, Courtney Radsch of CPJ said it’s a perilous time to be reporting.   “The past three years have been the most dangerous on record for journalists - with record killings, of imprisonment, and based on CPJ’s assistance data, more than 400 journalists have been forced into exile over the past five years,” said Radsch.   Internet censorship is a key weapon to stifle criticism. In North Korea, only the political elite have access to the Web. In Cuba, bloggers must upload from foreign embassies or hotels to get an unfiltered connection.     China’s 642 million Internet users face what''s called the “Great Firewall,” which blocks dissenting sites and social media. “Censorship is a very powerful tool, it does restrict information flows," said Radsch. "In order to bypass censorship you often have to have advanced technical skills, [know] what tools to use, what techniques and also how to keep their sources safe and their broader profiles safe.” Press crackdown The Arab Spring movement led to crackdowns in Eritrea, where the government scrapped plans to provide mobile Internet for its citizens. Since the Arab Spring, Saudi Arabia has amended press laws to prevent the publication of materials that contradict Sharia law or undermine public order. State-run media are often the only source of information in the 10 countries on the list. Radsch said the report’s publication lets journalists and citizens in these countries know the world is watching and that it cares.     In addition to China, Eritrea, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Iran, the CPJ''s top 10 most restrictive countries list also includes Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, Burma and Cuba.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:07:10 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ten-most-repressive-nations-for-media-identified/2728631.html\n'),
(272, 'S. Africa Deploys Army to Curb Xenophobic Attacks', '\nSouth Africa’s defense minister says the government will deploy military personnel to prevent further violence and criminality, after a wave of xenophobic attacks in two cities that have killed at least seven people. After weeks of violence in impoverished areas of Johannesburg and Durban, South Africa''s defense minister announced Tuesday that soldiers will join with police to stop the xenophobic attacks. The attacks, which began earlier this month, have displaced hundreds of African immigrants and led to hundreds of arrests. Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula described the situation as a “crisis.” Immigrants from African nations including Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Somalia and Zimbabwe have been among the targets of the attacks. Many have sought temporary shelter at makeshift camps, while some African embassies say they are seeing a steady stream of citizens trying to return home. No details provided National Defense Force spokesman Brig. Gen. Xolani Mabanga declined to give details of the military operation. He did not say how many personnel would be involved, what the operation would entail -- or even where exactly they would go, though he said they would be sent into “hotspots.” Those are likely to include the Johannesburg township of Alexandra and the impoverished settlement of Isipingo near the coastal city of Durban. “The plan is to provide the necessary support as may be required or requested by the South African Police Service in areas where the South African Police Service thinks or deems it necessary that they need the assistance and support from the South African National Defense Force," he explained. Mabanga stressed that the national defense forces were requested by police authorities, and that they have previously responded to calls for backup, such as during the last round of national elections in 2014. He also offered a message of encouragement to everyone in South Africa -- wherever they come from. “I would say to them that I think their safety and security is of concern to the South African National Defense Force," Mabanga said. Immigrant magnet Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the nation has been a magnet for millions of immigrants from elsewhere in Africa. Some critics of the nation’s immigration policy say there are not enough jobs to go around for South African citizens; about a quarter of the population is unemployed. And many South Africans who were disadvantaged under the unfair apartheid system say they have yet to see the economic equality they fought for, which has led some of them to blame immigrants for their woes. Even with these harsh conditions, South Africa has been shocked in recent days by images of the brutality shown towards foreign residents. Brutal attacks On Saturday, a South African journalist captured shocking photographs of four men stabbing Mozambican national Emmanuel Sithole in Johannesburg. Sithole was attacked just stumbling distance from a clinic, but the clinic''s doctor, a foreign national, did not report to work that day because he feared being attacked himself. The photographer helped Sithole to the nearest hospital, but he died of his wounds. The four men were arrested and appeared in court Tuesday. The presence of soldiers in poor, mostly black areas is likely to recall a very different era for many South Africans. During the apartheid years, soldiers from the South African Defense Force were heavily involved in policing what were then black-only areas.   That fact may not bode well for the soldiers preparing to go into tense areas.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 08:32:15 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/south-africa-deploys-army-to-curb-anti-immigrant-violence/2728470.html\n'),
(273, '\nWith Cuba at Summit, US Seeks Renewed Ties With Latin America\n', '\nThe Summit of the Americas normally receives little media attention in the United States. But this year is different because Cuba, unlike previous years, is invited to the gathering in Panama, which will take place April 10-11. U.S. officials say President Obama will interact with Cuban President Raúl Castro for the first time since announcing steps to normalize U.S.-Cuba relations. The last Summit of the Americas, in Cartagena, Colombia in 2012, is remembered for a scandal involving U.S. Secret Service agents and prostitutes. This year’s main attraction will be Cuba. For the first time, a delegation from Havana will be at the table - something President Obama welcomes after his December announcement to end more than a half-century of isolation. “Our shift in policy toward Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in the Americas. This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas,” said Obama. It is by welcoming Cuba the U.S. hopes to renew its leadership role in Latin America - a role that has been waning due to what analysts say is U.S. economic weakness and the region’s increasing engagement with China and others.  U.S. isolation of communist Cuba has been an issue for Latin American governments for years.  At the Cartagena summit, hemispheric leaders protested Washington’s exclusion of Havana from the gatherings. Michael Shifter heads the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington.  He said the invitation of Cuba is a significant gesture. “It has enormous symbolism over the last 50 years as the country that has been isolated by the United States, squeezed by the United States, not treated as a sovereign nation. So for Latin Americans, that’s very, very important,” said Shifter. But opponents of the U.S. rapprochement call Cuba’s participation at the summit a setback for democratic ideals in the region - even in a grouping that includes imperfect democracies like Venezuela.   Frank Calzón of the Center for a Free Cuba in Washington said Cuba has not enacted democratic reforms and - unlike Venezuela - does not have an elected government.   “There is a difference between an imperfect democracy that violates human rights and a totalitarian regime that has laws that in fact deny, under their own law, human rights,” said Calzón. Cuba’s participation at the summit in Panama will be largely symbolic.  Washington still lists Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. Wayne Smith, a retired diplomat who once worked at what was the U.S. Embassy in Cuba and later at the U.S. Interests section, said that needs to change before Cuba can be a full participant. “They can come to the summit but if we reach agreements at the summit that all the other members would be a party to, I’m not sure where that would leave Cuba and the U.S. There might be agreements that might be reached that we couldn’t be parties to with the Cubans,” said Smith. President Obama wants Cuba off the terrorist list, but has yet to announce its removal.  Experts say having Cuba at the table in Panama is a big - if only symbolic - step in the long road to full normalization of ties.\n', 'Tue, 07 Apr 2015 00:59:36 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/with-cuba-at-summit-us-seeks-renewed-ties-with-latin-america/2709411.html\n'),

(280, '\nVenezuelan ''Resistance'' Movement Struggles to Bruise Maduro\n', '\nHousewives stash bottles and fuel for Molotov cocktails. Activists run a network of safe houses. Masked youths block roads. A rifle-wielding dissident general makes a call to arms. From clandestine meetings to guerrilla-style broadcasts, an amorphous and quixotic "resistance" movement has emerged across Venezuela aspiring to force President Nicolas Maduro from power and end 16 years of socialist rule in the OPEC nation. The most hardcore still sporadically barricade streets with burning trash and pelt security forces with stones, or occasionally torch a government vehicle, especially in the western Andean regions they nickname "the Wild West." Some admit trying to connect with active and retired soldiers in the hope of a coup against Maduro. "We want to bring down the government. There''s no other way out," said one housewife in her fifties who helps coordinate the self-styled resistance in the central city of Valencia, a hotbed of protests last year that led to 43 deaths nationwide. She hurled stones at police, ferried students around and stored materials to make petrol bombs and spiked tubes known as "Miguelitos" that are laid on roads to puncture police vehicles. Upset at the failure of those protests, she tries to help keep the movement alive by organizing secret meetings and forging contacts with former military officials. Local ruling Socialist Party supporters recently outed and threatened her online, publishing photos of her and family members as well as her car license plate. "Go for her," one wrote. So she fled her apartment in a hillside upper-middle-class neighborhood in Valencia to lie low in Caracas. "They are breaking us down," she said, "but I can''t lose hope. How can I close my eyes and do nothing?" The radicals'' underground activities - aided by campaigners in Europe and the United States - are an embarrassment to mainstream opposition leaders hoping to oust Maduro at the ballot box. They say the hard-liners inadvertently help Maduro by enabling him to paint all opponents as extremists and allege foreign-backed coup plots against him. Some say government infiltrators play a role in the more extreme activities. Interviews by Reuters with dozens of people involved with the protest movement across Venezuela indicate that their numbers are relatively small and they lack a clear strategy. The more serious threats to Maduro do not seem to come from the "resistance" or even the mainstream opposition but rather from growing anger over a deep economic crisis and from factions within the ruling coalition. Though the top military brass parade their support for Maduro, rumors are rife of dissent and a handful of air force officers were recently arrested for allegedly plotting to bombard the presidential palace and topple him. Militant opposition activists know they cannot topple Maduro by themselves but hope to keep up pressure and be ready to help detonate a full-blown crisis if public unrest and internal divisions put his government in danger. "We are housewives, businessmen, students," said a 30-year-old man in the Andean city of Merida who identified himself only as Antonio and spoke to a reporter in a moving car and at the back of an empty bar playing loud music. He initially supported former socialist leader Hugo Chavez when he became president in 1999 but became disillusioned with his authoritarian style and statist economic policies. Now, after recently losing his job at a water bottling plant, Antonio helps transport people to clandestine meetings. Divided among myriad groups, it is hard to put a number on how many Venezuelans belong to the nebulous radical opposition. Government sources talk disparagingly of a few hundred misguided "criminals" while activists boast of tens of thousands of would-be "liberators". Analysts estimate a few thousand. The militants view Maduro, Chavez''s protege who was elected to power in April 2013 after the late leader succumbed to cancer, as a puppet of Cuba''s communist leaders Fidel and Raul Castro, and accuse him of wrecking the economy. They also show disdain for opposition parties, who have time and again lost elections against Chavez and Maduro. "The resistance is a product of the opposition''s failures," said Antonio. ''Psycho No. 12'' The anger is fueled by economic and social crisis - long supermarket lines, shortages of basics, the highest inflation in the Americas and the world''s second highest murder rate. Maduro''s approval ratings have slumped and the opposition has a good chance of winning control of parliament in elections later this year, though members of the "resistance" are convinced officials will use fraud to prevent that happening. With state security on their tails and making regular arrests, most of the militants who spoke to Reuters hid their identities. Some only meet each other under trees after dark. One activist in Caracas, who helps people who are on the run, carries a wig and a suitcase of clothes in her car, ready for quick escapes to safe houses. She said she receives so many abusive calls from government supporters that she stores the numbers on her phone in contacts as "Psycho." "I have a Psycho 1, Psycho 2 ... up to No. 12!" she said. While using encrypted chat mechanisms, pseudonyms like "The Specialist" or "Kaiser", and sometimes foreign languages to try to avoid detection, they also display naivety by, for example, taking group photos in cafes and posting them on social media. Arguably the most prominent member, though, makes no attempt to conceal his identity. At the height of last year''s protests, retired army general Angel Vivas, 59, took to the roof of his Caracas home wielding an assault rifle in defiance of an apparent arrest order. Since then, he has published videos on YouTube urging supporters to take up arms. "The aim of the resistance is to expel this Castro communist invasion from Venezuelan territory and punish, with all the severity of the law, the traitors in its service," he told Reuters at his large home, sitting in front of a portrait of independence hero Simon Bolivar. In a cabinet, Vivas keeps models of past Venezuelan presidents. Chavez is upside-down, and Maduro missing. Why Vivas has not been arrested is a source of conjecture Political analyst Miguel Angel Albujas said it is because the general''s call to arms had little impact and he is seen as a laughing stock in official circles. By contrast, hardline opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez has been in prison for more than a year for leading anti-government protests and Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma was jailed in February on charges of conspiring to overthrow Maduro. "Chavez stopped resistance with his charisma," said Albujas, a university professor. "Maduro doesn''t have that, so he resorts to repression ... but only when the threat is real." Lorent Saleh, 26, is a younger public face of the resistance. He was arrested in September when authorities published videos of him discussing apparent bomb and assassination plots. Despite the damning broadcasts, his mother, Yamile Saleh, says the videos were fabricated. "The government is trying to scare young people," she said. Maduro regularly invokes the Saleh case, showing videos, emails and photos to back his claims that U.S.-backed extremists want to stage a coup. Plotting has been a staple of Venezuelan politics in recent decades. As a young army officer, Chavez led a failed coup in 1992 and a decade later, in power, he survived a short-lived putsch against him. The "resistance" draws support from Venezuelan emigres and foreign sympathizers, who run web sites, lobby international bodies and offer outside logistics. Ana Diaz, who left Venezuela in 2004 and lives in Miami, is a prominent supporter, sending sends gas masks, protective gloves and even energy bars to opposition radicals across her home country. "The kids need protein," she said. Ulf Erlingsson, a Swede and former aid worker, helped found the Operation Venezuelan Liberty web site four years ago after becoming convinced Venezuela was a nefarious influence. "This is a criminal regime run by a foreign power, Cuba," he told Reuters.

Fernandez, in a speech honoring soldiers who died in her country''s failed 1982 invasion of the South Atlantic islands, dismissed the idea of Argentina being a threat, telling Britain to focus instead on fighting poverty within its own borders. "What a paradox,'''' Fernandez chided, "when there are more than 1 million Britons eating at the food banks they have had to open in one of the most powerful countries in the world.'''' "Don''t spend another pound sterling on defending the Malvinas,'''' she added, using the Argentine term for the Falklands.

President Barack Obama has loosened some Cold War-era travel restrictions, allowing Americans to visit the Caribbean island for a range of reasons, such as family visits or education. U.S. lawmakers have proposed further easing to permit purely tourist travel, but that remains illegal for Americans in Cuba under a five-decades-old trade embargo. Airbnb said that after Obama announced the changes, it saw a 70 percent spike in U.S. searches for rentals in Cuba. In response, it has added more than 1,000 listings on the island. Americans booking stays in Cuba on the site will have to assert that they have a license from the U.S. government to travel there. Airbnb''s Cuba services are open only to U.S. travelers but could expand to include people from other countries, the company said. "They made us this proposal a few days ago and we''re delighted to accept what they offered us,'''' said Reinier Torres, who manages a Havana home on Airbnb''s service. "It''s a great opportunity for us to attract American tourism ... though we haven''t seen any practical results yet.'''' The National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that pushes for open international trade, said Airbnb''s expansion would help meet "soaring demand'''' for lodging in Cuba. U.S. travel companies licensed to offer educational and cultural tours to Cuba are reporting a surge in interest from Americans, with bookings for this year up steeply. Airline charter companies flying to Cuba from two Florida cities, Miami and Tampa, are also reporting increased business. In the first three months of 2015, they reported about 175,000 passengers. Travel experts say Cuba''s state-run hotel sector lacks the capacity to handle a major increase in U.S. visitors, without the variety of high-end hotels found in other destinations. The private bed-and-breakfast option is increasingly poised to pick up the slack in the state sector and could spur investment in hotel construction, said Emilio Morales, president of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami. There are between 6,000 to 8,000 rooms for rent in private homes in Havana, priced about $30 to 35 a night, compared with $150 to $200 in standard hotels. A lack of Internet and banking services in Cuba still greatly limits online private sector transactions. But Cubans are already familiar with similar services in Canada and Europe that offer prepaid home stays in Cuba, using money transfer and cash delivery systems to pay homeowners, Morales said.

(287, 'Massive Fire Engulfs Mexican Oil Rig, Four Dead', '\nA massive ball of flames engulfed an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, killing four people and sending terrified workers jumping into the sea. State-run oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, said there was no evidence yet of a major oil spill following the blast, which injured 16 workers, two seriously, and forced the evacuation of 300. Fleets of helicopters ferried workers with bandaged hands and faces, and burn marks on their overalls to the nearby city of Ciudad del Carmen, where crowds of concerned relatives of oil workers thronged outside hospitals. A survivor of the blaze on the shallow-water Abkatun Permanente platform in the Campeche Sound said workers "jumped into the sea out of desperation and panic." "There was nothing you could do but run," said Roger Arias Sanchez, an employee of Pemex contractor Cotemar who escaped the burning platform in an evacuation boat. Eight firefighting boats were trying to extinguish the fire, said Pemex. Mexico''s Energy Security Agency said the fire "is being extinguished." On its Twitter account Wednesday afternoon, Pemex raised the death toll from one to four.  Many of the injured appeared to be Cotemar employees. Pemex''s media office said it was unclear whether any significant amount of oil had spilled from the Abkatun Permanente platform, which largely serves to separate gas, oil and other petroleum products, and pump them to refineries onshore. Previous spills from Mexican facilities had usually occurred at active offshore wells, not processing stations like Abkatun. The Abkatun platform lies off the coast of the states of Campeche and Tabasco. It is further out to sea than the platform involved in the last severe fire in the area, the 2007 fire at the Kab 121 offshore rig. That accident was caused by high waves that hit the rig, sending a boom crashing into an oil platform''s valve assembly. The blaze killed at least 21 workers and the rig spilled crude and natural gas for almost two months. Mexico''s worst major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979, when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters — the Ixtoc I — blew up, releasing 140 million gallons of oil. It took Pemex and a series of U.S. contractors nearly nine months to cap the well, and a great deal of the oil contaminated Mexican and U.S. waters.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 16:02:33 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-massive-fire-engulfs-mexican-oil-rig-four-dead/2703142.html\n'),
(288, '\nFloods Death Toll Rises in Chile, President Cancels Trips\n', '\nThe death toll from heavy rains and flooding that battered Chile last week has risen to 23, with another 57 still missing, and President Michelle Bachelet said on Wednesday she would cancel upcoming trips to lead ongoing reconstruction efforts. The freak torrential downpours in the Atacama desert, normally the driest in the world, destroyed homes and bridges, cut off roads, and left thousands stranded as rivers broke their banks and flash floods dramatically filled dry valleys. Although the rains ceased by the end of last week, the clear-up operation continues, with emergency office Onemi saying on Wednesday around 4,000 people were still in temporary housing and a night-time curfew remained in place for the worst affected areas, where looting has been reported. The Chilean air force said on Wednesday that it was looking for a helicopter  that had disappeared in the Copiapo area. It was not immediately clear who was on board, although media reported that the helicopter was privately owned and carrying out rescue operations. Rescuers say it is highly probable that the death toll will rise as more victims are found buried under tons of mud and rubble strewn over the worst-hit areas in northern Chile. Mines in Chile, the world''s top copper exporter, have not reported any serious damage, although blocked roads forced operations to halt at some projects. Bachelet Reaction Center-left Bachelet has been keen to show she has learnt lessons after her government came under heavy fire in 2010 for a perceived slow response to a massive earthquake and tsunami. “I have instructed the government to keep working non-stop until people''s lives have returned to normal,” she said on Wednesday, adding that she was canceling international trips scheduled for next week. She had planned to attend the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of leaders from the Western Hemisphere, in Panama and visit Ecuador. Chile was praised for its fast reaction to a quake in the north last year. But the government has been criticized by some Chileans for a too-slow response to the developing crisis after the floods. After a torrid month of natural and political disasters, the president''s popularity rating has hit an all-time low.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 13:33:25 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-floods-death-toll-chile-president-cancels-trips/2702861.html\n'),
(289, '\nRio Residents Protest Olympic Eviction With Road Block\n', '\nResidents of a squatter settlement in Brazil marked for demolition to make way for the Olympic Park protested against eviction on Wednesday, blocking a main road into Rio de Janeiro during morning rush-hour traffic. Cars were gridlocked for at least five kilometers in Rio''s southern neighborhood of Barra de Tijuca after around 30 residents stood in the road, holding aloft banners, singing and hitting pans. The protesters are the holdouts of Vila Autodromo, a squatter settlement, or favela, located beside the Olympic Park, where more than 20 sports will be held during the games in 2016. More than 90 percent of the favela residents have already moved after pressure and various offers from local government, but around 50 families refuse to leave despite irregular access to basic services like water and electricity. Rio''s City Hall says the land on which Vila Autodromo is located is needed to build an access road to the park. Residents suspect the land will be used to build luxury apartments after the games are finished, as is the plan for other Olympic developments such as the Athletes Village. Although small, Wednesday''s protest was one of the first specifically against the Olympics, now 500 days away. The run-up to the World Cup last year was marked by the largest street protests in decades by Brazilians angry about the billions spent to host the event. While few are predicting similar demonstrations against the Olympics, social discontent is bubbling just below the surface. “City Hall has never had any patience to properly negotiate with us. Now it''s time to shout about our pain, our exclusion,” Inalva Brito, 69, who has lived in Vila Autodromo for 40 years, told Reuters.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 13:14:48 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-rio-residents-protest-olympic-eviction-with-road-block/2702840.html\n'),
(290, 'Peru''s PM, Government to Resign After Censure Vote', '\nPeru''s prime minister will resign after losing a confidence vote in Congress following allegations of spying on her opponents, delivering a blow to President Ollanta Humala, who will now have to form another new government. The censure by lawmakers in the opposition-controlled house forces Prime Minister Ana Jara and her entire government to resign, damaging Humala''s efforts to bolster consumer and business confidence ahead of next year''s presidential election. Underscoring investor angst at the prospect of a seventh prime minister during the nearly four years that Humala has been in power, Peru''s currency opened weaker on Tuesday, falling through the psychological barrier of 3.1 sols per dollar. Seventy-two lawmakers voted late Monday against Jara in the censure motion that came less than a year after she took office, while 42 backed her. "It is an honor that this Congress has censured me," Jara said in a Twitter message. She denies snooping on rivals, journalists sympathetic to the opposition and businessmen. Humala will be constitutionally bound to accept Jara''s resignation, which must come within 72 hours of the vote.    While Humala must name a new prime minister, he can reappoint cabinet ministers. There were no immediate indications from the president on whether he would replace Economy Minister Alonso Segura, who is popular among investors and Peru''s business community. Humala''s approval rating has hovered around 25 percent this year, according to polling firm Ipsos Peru. Humala has dismissed criticism as political noise ahead of next year''s presidential vote. He is constitutionally barred from seeking a second straight term. The spying scandal forced a restructuring of Peru''s National Intelligence Office, which answers to the prime minister. The political climate of the metals-producing country will deteriorate ahead of 2016 vote, consultancy Eurasia Group told clients in a note ahead of Monday''s vote. "Still, with no meaningful reforms pending discussion, this will have limited policy impact," Eurasia said.

(291, 'Argentine Workers Strike Over Income Tax Rate', '\nArgentina''s public transport networks ground to a halt Tuesday, while port workers at the grains export hub of Rosario refused to work and banks shut their doors as a one-day strike to back demands for changes to income tax rates gripped the country. The strike caused major disruptions to domestic air travel, garbage was left piling up on sidewalks and many businesses stayed closed as employees struggled to reach work, frustrating owners already grappling with a weak economy. In the face of high inflation, the transport unions spearheading the strike are demanding Argentina''s leftist government raise the minimum threshold on paying income tax. The unions complain that more workers will have to pay tax if double-digit salary hikes designed to keep pace with inflation are awarded without lifting the threshold for the lowest tax bracket. The government said inflation was 24 percent in 2014, but private economists estimate it was about 35 percent. The prospect of intensifying labor disputes as unions knuckle down to wage negotiations is another headache for President Cristina Fernandez, who is battling to revive a stagnant economy and avoid a deepening of the government''s latest debt default. "This strike is our answer to the government''s refusal to listen to our plea that it''s unfair to keep deducting money from our wages,'''' Pablo Moyano of the powerful Truck Drivers Union told Radio con Vos, calling the walkout a "total success." "The government has to listen to the demands of workers,'''' said bank employee Claudia Ferretti, who complained about the burden of taxes on her income. "Inflation is eating into what we have left in our pockets after taxes.'''' The owner of a small textiles factory who gave his name as Daniel said: "I understand the claim for changes to income tax, but I can''t afford to have the factory standing still for even a day.'''' With a presidential election looming in October, Fernandez will want to avoid a wave of politically damaging protests. Government insiders have expressed concern that unions sympathetic to the opposition will intensify their demands and launch more strikes in the months ahead. One source familiar with Fernandez''s thinking said earlier this month that the government was considering altering the lowest tax bracket. But over the weekend, Economy Minister Axel Kicillof said no changes were planned. "This strike is hurting many people who want to get to work,'''' Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez told reporters in a daily briefing. Asked whether there was a political undercurrent to the strike, he replied: "We''re in an election year.''''\n', 'Tue, 31 Mar 2015 17:24:41 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/argentine-workers-strike-over-income-tax-rate/2701771.html\n'),

(293, '\nMexican Teen Wrongly Taken to US Returned to Family\n', '\nA 14-year-old Mexican girl who was taken by authorities and sent screaming to live in the United States was returned home Wednesday after DNA tests showed she is not the daughter of the Houston woman who claimed her. The case of Alondra Luna Nunez drew international attention after a video of the distraught girl being forced into a police vehicle last week circulated in media and on social networks. The Foreign Ministry said Mexican officials were carrying out a court order to send Alondra to Dorotea Garcia, a Houston woman who claimed the girl was her daughter who had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father years ago. Alondra''s family insisted authorities were mistaken but their pleas were ignored. ''It''s terrible'' "It''s terrible that they could do this do you," the mother, Susana Nunez, told The Associated Press at an evening barbecue in Guanajuato, where two dozen family members celebrated the girl''s return with balloons, streamers, and sizzling steak and chorizo sausage. Wearing jeans, a gray T-shirt and a silver necklace with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Alondra laughed and hugged her brothers, cousins, aunts and uncles. As the sun went down in the hilly working-class neighborhood where they live, family and friends lit candles and recited the rosary on a sidewalk. Alondra wept as an elderly neighbor swept her into an embrace that lasted for minutes. "At first I was very upset because I had never been so far away from my parents," Alondra said. But she said she was optimistic the mistake would be remedied. "So after a while I calmed down a bit." Garcia, speaking to a Houston television station, said the first time she saw the girl, "I saw my daughter." She gave few details about how she ended up leaving Mexico with the girl, although she said she knows many won''t look kindly on her actions. "The people who know me don''t need me to give an explanation for what happened," she said later to the AP. "Whatever explanation I give won''t change the minds of people in Mexico or here." Mexican agents assigned to Interpol took Alondra from her middle school in the central state of Guanajuato on April 16 and transported her to a courtroom in the neighboring state of Michoacan, according to a statement from the federal Attorney General''s Office. Birth certificates In court, Alondra''s parents and Garcia each presented birth certificates and gave testimony, then the judge ruled in favor of Garcia, ordering the girl into her custody, according to the court in Michoacan. A court official, who was not authorized to speak to the press, said on condition of anonymity that Alondra''s parents didn''t present proper documents. Alondra, upon returning to Mexico, said she asked for a DNA test and the judge turned her down. The judge who ruled on the case said it wasn''t within her duties to order a DNA test. "We as judges are only responsible to resolve the case with respect to recovering the minor," Judge Cinthia Elodia Mercado told the AP. "We don''t do investigations or make inquiries." Alondra and Garcia went by bus to Houston, crossing at Laredo, Texas, with the birth certificate of Garcia''s daughter and the court order, according to the Foreign Ministry. Alondra recorded a video, posted to social media, in which she looked calm and happy and told her parents in Mexico not to worry as they waited for results of a DNA test there. "I''m fine. I see that the United States is nice. I don''t understand anything they''re saying, because everything is in English," she said in the video. She said Wednesday that she was only trying to reassure her family and didn''t really feel fine. DNA test The Foreign Ministry intervened to request the DNA test because of the commotion the video was causing. Many things remained unclear, including who called Interpol from the U.S. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said U.S. officials had encouraged "timely processing of this case through appropriate government channels." It was not clear what further action, if any, the department might take on the matter. It was also unclear how the girl came to be identified as Garcia''s daughter. In 2007, the Foreign Ministry received a claim stating Garcia''s then 4-year-old daughter, Alondra Diaz Garcia, had been taken by her father from the U.S. and was believed to be in Michoacan. This year, Garcia went to Mexico and said she had found her daughter in Guanajuato, prompting U.S. authorities to seek the help of Interpol in retrieving her. Meanwhile, Alondra Diaz Garcia remains missing. Reynaldo Diaz is suspected of abducting her from Houston in 2007, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. A felony warrant has been issued for his arrest.\n', 'Thu, 23 Apr 2015 01:00:12 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/mexican-teen-wrongly-taken-to-us-returned-to-family/2731222.html\n'),

The inaugural games will be held Sept. 18-27 in Palmas in the northern state of Tocantins. "It''s a very important moment for Brazil,'''' Brazil''s sports minister, George Hilton, told Reuters on Wednesday. "It''s a time of exchanging knowledge and it''s a good time to promote the indigenous peoples through the games.'''' Hilton said 48 ethnicities would be represented among 4,000 athletes from 22 countries. Brazil, home to nearly 900,000 indigenous peoples, who speak 274 languages, has held a dozen Indigenous Games for its own natives since 1996 and decided to expand the games into a truly international event. The Brazilians are to make a presentation about the games at the United Nations on Friday to delegations that participate in the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. A Canadian indigenous leader named Little Child will speak, Hilton said. The sports to be contested will include rokra, a type of lacrosse that uses sticks and coconuts, and xikunahity, a variety of soccer in which only the head is used to move the ball. "This event will be a cultural interchange among the tribes, and it''s very important for all involved,'''' Hilton said. "It''s not only about the games, but they are also going to be showing their culture through food, through their art, and they are bringing their own interpreters so that one tribe can communicate with the other.'''' Worldwide, it is estimated that there are 370 million indigenous peoples making up more than 5 percent of the world''s population, according to the U.N.

(296, 'Volcano Calbuco Erupts in Southern Chile', '\nVolcano Calbuco in southern Chile erupted for the first time in more than five decades on Wednesday, sending a thick plume of ash and smoke several kilometers into the sky. Chile''s Onemi emergency office declared a red alert following the sudden eruption at around 1800 local time (2100 GMT), which occurred about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) south of Santiago, the capital, near the tourist town of Puerto Varas. About 1,500 people were being moved out of the area and an evacuation radius of 20 km has been established, authorities said. “In this situation, with the eruption column so high, the main risk is that it collapses, falls due to gravity because of its own weight and causes a pyroclastic flow,” Gabriel Orozco, a vulcanologist with Chile''s geological and mining service, said on local TV. A pyroclastic flow is a superheated current of gas and rock that can destroy nearly everything in its path and travel at speeds upwards of 200 to 300 kilometers per hour. LATAM Airlines said it has canceled flights to and from neighboring Puerto Montt, the area''s largest city, due to the presence of volcanic ash, which can potentially damage aircraft and make flying dangerous. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some 10 km from the volcano, said he and his family fled when the volcano erupted. The 2,003-meter-tall Volcano Calbuco saw its last major eruption in 1961. “It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling. ... We left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife,” Moffat said. “All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction,” said Canada-born Moffat, who was driving to nearby Puerto Varas. Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through. The eruption was seen in towns at least 50 kilometers away. “There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas,” Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said. “A friend told me to fill everything we have with water,” Way added. Chile, on the Pacific “Rim of Fire,” has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, Volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 20:23:09 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/chile-volcano-erupts/2731125.html\n'),
(298, '\nUS-Cuba Relations Challenge Ballplayers Choosing Pro Path\n', '\nYasmany Tomas had three choices to continue his baseball career: stay in Cuba and make up to $2,500 a month, play in Japan with a shot at a million dollar contract, or give up family and life in the island on hopes of hitting the jackpot in the major leagues. The 24-year-old Cuban slugger opted for life in the U.S., and all the changes that come with it, signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks for $68.5 million for six seasons. While travel and business restrictions between the United States and Cuba are being eased, it''s not clear when Tomas will see his family again. It could be years before they''re together once more, whether in the states or on the communist island, as he''s given up his right to return to his former life. Amid dual pressures of pro sports and being in a foreign country away from family for the first time, Tomas and dozens of players navigate those choices and life changes with their families through uncharted political waters, as the U.S. and Cuba began 2015 with steps to improve rocky relations. “I would love to be there in the stands when he starts to play, to give him the support we''ve always given him,” said Tomas'' mother, Melba Rosa Bacallao, holding back tears as she sifted through an album with pictures of her son from her two-bedroom house in Havana. “He always tells me that his daughter and we are his priorities, that he wants to get ahead in life for us.” Complicated landscape Optimism in both countries and demand from U.S. teams are clearly growing despite the complicated landscape. The governments have made few tangible policy changes that significantly impact players, their relatives and the game. Baseball is treading carefully, not wanting to step on diplomatic toes. There were 74 Cubans on major or minor league rosters on opening day, 11 more than last year and more than double the 29 in 2008. Most developed in state-run academies where kids breathe baseball from an early age. Baseball''s lure has rippled through Cuba, where attitudes toward the U.S. have softened in the last few years as the island adapts to social, political and economic changes. President Barack Obama met recently with Cuban President Raul Castro, and the island will be taken off the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Players in Cuba talk openly about wanting to play in the United States, commenting in ways that used to be considered sinful by authorities who severely punished big league dreams. Officials have also discussed playing spring training games on the island, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. And through deals in other countries not limited by the U.S. embargo, Cuba has shown signs it is willing to let players enter baseball''s free market. “Of course I would like to play where they play the best baseball in the world,” Yulieski Gourriel, star infielder for the national team, said during the Caribbean Series in Puerto Rico in February. “As long as we have authorization, we''ll always want to do so.” Gourriel made $1 million in Japan last season, then returned to his pro team in Havana. After accounting for Japanese taxes, he paid 10 percent to Cuba''s baseball federation (which acted as his agent), taking home enough to be rich in a communist country with limited options for spending and investment. Leaving isn''t always as difficult and dramatic as it used to be. Teen sensation Yoan Moncada, who in March agreed to a record $31.5 million signing bonus with the Boston Red Sox, left Cuba last year thanks to 2013 laws that allow citizens to travel abroad without an exit visa. No midnight speedboat to Mexico, no shady smugglers. He asked for and was granted release, established residency in Guatemala, then worked out for MLB clubs. Ballplayers released by the federation can travel elsewhere legally, said Antonio Diaz, a spokesman for Cuba''s baseball federation. Moncada “was discharged because he was of no interest to the national team,” he said. But, in accordance with the embargo, those hoping to play in the U.S. must sign an affidavit that says they won''t return to Cuba. Little face-to-face with family Face-to-face contact with family becomes tough. Cuban law allows defectors to revisit eight years after departing, which former MLB players Jose Contreras and Rey Ordonez utilized two years ago. But U.S. immigration and strict tourist regulations regarding Cuba haven''t changed. “It''s very difficult. It takes a lot of time to get a visa for your family in Cuba,” said Seattle Mariners pitcher Roenis Elias, who fled Cuba in 2010. Changes in Cuba-U.S. policy since December have come mainly from the American side and aren''t specific to baseball. In January, the U.S. quadrupled the amount U.S. residents could send to Cubans to $2,000 per quarter. It also eased travel restrictions for Americans and loosened controls on U.S. businesses to spur the island''s small private sector. Netflix, MasterCard and online home rental service Airbnb have entered the Cuban market, though few on the island have high-speed Internet and most credit card issuers prohibit transactions from the country. No MLB on-demand yet. “Everybody is kind of figuring it out as we go, taking our lead from the diplomatic talks,” Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi said. “That''s the optimistic view, that there''ll be greater openness.” Teams aren''t shy to spend huge amounts to snatch up the next big-league stars like Yasiel Puig or Jose Abreu. Boston signed Rusney Castillo last year for $72.5 million over seven years. “They''ve shown that they''re ready to play in the major leagues, and that they can do it almost immediately,” said Junior Noboa, the Diamondbacks VP for Latin America. Next in line for a big bonus could be infielder Andy Ibanez, the youngest player for Cuba during the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Ibanez left the country illegally. Departing Cuba and signing a contract are but the first of many issues for players and their families. Starting ‘from zero’ “They have to start from zero, they have no idea what''s going on,” said Ariel Prieto, a 45-year old former Oakland Athletics pitcher hired by the Diamondbacks to mentor Tomas. “They know baseball, but they don''t know the different philosophy of U.S. teams.” Tomas said he passed on offers from Japanese teams, leaving behind his immediate family and a then 8-month-old daughter. He is focused on life''s new encounters: autograph seekers, income taxes, local traffic laws. The sport and its universal language help the transition - baseball, after all, is called “beisbol” in Spanish, a home run is a “jonron,” and a strike is, well, a “strike.” Away from the field, his thoughts drift home to Havana, where a flat-screen TV and new Chinese refrigerator are some of the perks his newfound riches have provided his family. Tomas thinks improved relations should make it easier for players to reunite with relatives. “It would be something good, beautiful, to be able to be with your family after so much time without seeing them,” Tomas said. His mother just wants to make sure he''s eating well and handling his unique opportunity properly. “I think he doesn''t know what that kind of money means,” she said. “Even I can''t imagine.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:19:59 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-us-cuba-major-league-baseball/2731063.html\n');

(299, 'US Farm Exports to Cuba Set to Grow', '\nAgriculture experts say U.S. farm exports to Cuba could more than triple in the next five years - reaching $1 billion - and support thousands of new U.S. jobs. Farmers and government officials told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee recently, however, that both Washington and Havana must remove more legal, logistical, and financial obstacles to reach this goal. President Barack Obama recently eased restrictions on trade and travel to Cuba and allowed Cuban-Americans to send larger amounts of money to their families on the communist-ruled island. But Obama can’t end the decades-old trade embargo against Cuba without congressional approval. Major resistance There is strong opposition to ending the embargo or taking other steps to ease restrictions from some Cuban-American members of Congress who call such steps “appeasement” of dictators and a threat to U.S. security. They argue that expanded trade would support a hostile authoritarian government far more than it helps Cuban consumers. An expert on relations between Cuba and the United States, New York University''s Arturo Lopez-Levy, disagrees with these critics, but he said it may take several years to fully normalize relations between the former Cold War adversaries. Cuba could be a much larger business opportunity for U.S. farm products because the island imports about 80 percent of the food consumed by its 11 million people, according to Michael Scuse of the U.S. Agriculture Department. Scuse and other witnesses said Cuba buys food from distant lands like Vietnam, New Zealand, the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. That rice, wheat, corn, milk, and fruit is available from the United States with lower shipping costs, giving Cuban consumers a price break, and leaving more room for farmers to profit. Enabling smaller companies U.S. farmers have been selling food to Cuba for a few years, after an earlier partial easing of the trade embargo, but they complain they are losing business to other nations because current U.S. law blocks the kind of marketing and financing their rivals use to sell more goods. Minnesota cattle rancher Ralph Kaehler said large companies may have the resources to prosper without help from the U.S. Agriculture Department, but small companies like his do not. Farmer Doug Keesling, whose family has been raising wheat in Kansas for five generations, said the current U.S. “rules and laws” complicate financing and make it “too expensive” to compete for business in Cuba. These farmers and other experts also complain the Cuban government requires U.S. goods to go through its “Alimport” organization, needlessly complicating and slowing down such transactions. Some business, though, is already underway. Officials at the U.S. port of New Orleans say they ship 25,000 tons of frozen chicken from American producers to Cuba each year, and are “optimistic” the trade will grow in volume and variety. Making progress Matt Gresham said New Orleans was one of the island’s largest trading partners prior to the embargo, and could eventually regain that status. He said the Cuban people will likely need farm products, machinery and many other goods, but he expects it will take a while for the island’s economy to expand enough to create additional buying power.

(301, '\nPope to Visit Cuba En Route US, Capping Diplomatic Role\n', '\nPope Francis will visit Cuba en route to the United States in September, the Vatican said on Wednesday, capping his success in bringing the former enemies together after more than half a century of frozen antagonism. Last December, Havana and Washington announced after 18 months of secret diplomacy brokered by the pope''s diplomats and Canada that the two sides were working to reopen embassies in their respective capitals. Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi did not specify how long the stop in Cuba would last, saying only that Francis had accepted invitations made by the Cuban government and the Cuban Roman Catholic Church. Papal visit It will be the Argentine pope''s first visit to the Caribbean island nation as pontiff. Both his predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, visited the island and met revolutionary leader Fidel Castro. "The presence of his holiness in Cuba will be memorable. He will receive the warmest hospitality of the Cuban people," Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news conference during a visit to Brussels. He spoke after talks with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who announced the EU and Cuba had agreed to set up a "structured human rights dialogue" with an initial meeting in Brussels in June. That would be in parallel with talks on trade and investment that the two sides have launched. Presidential thanks Monsignor Jose Felix Perez of the Cuban Catholic Bishops'' Conference told Reuters in Havana that both Cuban President Raul Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama had thanked Pope Francis for his mediation. "His mediation, without a doubt, was effective and in line with the Christian spirit that always brings out reconciliation as the solution to conflicts," Perez said. Cuba had been a focal point for Vatican diplomats ever since Fidel Castro took power in 1959 and restricted church activities in what had been a staunchly Catholic country. The Vatican''s opposition to the U.S. embargo on Cuba over the decades gave it credibility with Havana as a diplomatic broker while at the same time it had good relations with a string of U.S. administrations. Initiating new ties Obama visited the pope last year and discussed Cuba. Francis later wrote personal letters to Obama and Raul Castro urging them to "initiate a new phase" in their relations. Obama and Castro met on April 11 at the Summit of the Americas in Panama, the first formal face-to-face meeting of the two countries'' leaders in more than half a century. After Pope John Paul visited Cuba in 1998, Francis, who was then a bishop, wrote a book called "Dialogues between John Paul and Fidel Castro" that touched on themes such as family, education, poverty and political ideologies on the island. The pope is due to arrive in Washington on Sept. 22 and will also visit New York and Philadelphia.

The Roswell Park Cancer Center of Buffalo, New York, on Tuesday signed an agreement with Cuba''s Center for Molecular Immunology to develop a lung cancer vaccine with a clinical trial in the United States, Roswell Chief Executive Officer Candace Johnson said. In addition, New York City-based software company Infor Global Solutions has identified a Cuban partner and reached an agreement to resell software in Cuba, CEO Charles Phillips said. Both announcements were made at the airport just before Cuomo and a delegation of 18 business leaders and academics boarded their return flight to New York. Cuomo, a Democrat, is the first governor to visit Cuba since a December announcement by President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that they would restore diplomatic relations and work to normalize trade and travel ties after more than a half century of hostility and confrontation. Obama has used executive authority to relax some parts of the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba but would need the Republican-controlled Congress to lift it entirely and establish normal trade. Among those on the trip were executives from JetBlue Airways, Pfizer and MasterCard. Cuomo had said the mission was meant to help New York companies be "first out of the gate'''' to make business deals under warming U.S.-Cuban relations. Roswell was able to finalize the agreement for a clinical trial as a result of the trade mission, Johnson said.

Demands that Santos abandon two-year-old negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have mounted after rebels last week broke a unilateral ceasefire, killing 11 soldiers in an ambush. While the attack prompted Santos to restart halted air raids against FARC camps, the opposition, spearheaded by ex-president Alvaro Uribe, say the rebels have abused the process. The attack has revived mistrust of rebel intentions at the negotiating table, the government has said. “We will not allow ourselves to be pressured by those who want, at all costs, to back us against a wall and force us to end the negotiations,” Santos said at a meeting of the national peace commission. “It''s easy to keep talking about war while sitting at a desk or from the trenches of social media,” Santos added, alluding to Uribe, now a senator, and other opposition leaders who have used social media networks such as Twitter to criticize the talks. Uribe''s allies in his right-wing Democratic Center party say FARC will not face proper punishment for human rights abuses and that many fighters will continue criminal activity. Although the rebel group has said it will not serve prison terms, Santos has ruled out immunity and has said it will be obliged to atone for crimes committed. “FARC leaders, the ball is in your court, now is the time to demonstrate that peace is also what you dream of,” Santos said.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 16:29:29 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/santos-colombia-farc-peace-talks/2729188.html\n'),
(305, '\nOfficial: Honduras Foiled 2014 Cartel Plot to Kill President\n', '\nHonduran security forces foiled an international plan last year by drug traffickers to assassinate President Juan Hernandez after he launched a crackdown on organized crime, the government said on Tuesday. Security ministry spokesman Leonel Sauceda said the plot hatched by Colombian, Mexican, Honduran and Guatemalan gangsters was to kill Hernandez upon his arrival at the airport of the town of Gracias, in western Honduras, between Sept. 21-22. Hernandez, who arrived in Washington on Monday to canvas U.S. support for a plan to boost investment in Central American countries plagued by violence, took office in January 2014. Honduras has the world''s highest murder rate and along with El Salvador and Guatemala, has been seeking to raise billions of dollars to spur growth in an effort to reduce crime and cut migration to the United States, which sparked a border crisis last year. Sauceda said Honduran police and military officials discovered the assassination plot via intelligence gathering. Several gang leaders had been detained in connection with the plot and were handed over to authorities in their respective home countries, he added. Since taking office, Hernandez has sought to hit back at local crime bosses with a series of arrests as well as by ordering the seizure of their businesses, assets and luxury residences. A number of accused drug traffickers have also been extradited to the United States to face trial. Sauceda said that Hernandez did not reveal details of the conspiracy on his life at the time so as not to divert the government''s focus from its fight against organized crime. Honduran security forces made a number of arrests prior to September to foil the plot, Sauceda said, without giving details as to how many. Among the Honduran gangs suspected of involvement in the plot was the Valle Valle cartel, whose assets were seized, he added.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 13:30:58 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/official-says-honduras-fopiled-2014-cartel-plot-to-kill-president/2728915.html\n'),
(306, 'Kerry Says US Open to Improved Ties With Venezuela', '\nSecretary of State John Kerry says the U.S. is open to further addressing its differences with Venezuela and attempting to find common ground. “It is no secret that relations between our two countries have been severely strained in recent years,” Kerry said Tuesday at the Washington Conference on the Americas. The annual event is held by the Council of the Americas, an international business group dedicated to economic and social development in the Western Hemisphere. Kerry said the U.S. was committed to forging a new kind of relationship with Latin America based on common goals such as strengthening democracy and ensuring respect for human rights. The U.S. and Venezuela have locked horns over a number of issues recently. In March, the U.S. declared Venezuela a security threat and imposed sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials. The U.S. said the officials had engaged in acts of corruption and human rights violations, but the move prompted harsh criticism from Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro. Also, in a 2014 report, the U.S. State Department cited Venezuela as one of the most frequently used routes for drug trafficking out of South America. Although Venezuela is one of the top suppliers of foreign oil to the United States, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. In his remarks, Kerry noted that President Barack Obama had spoken briefly with Maduro on the sidelines of this month’s Summit of the Americas hosted by Panama, and that senior State Department officials had recently visited Caracas at the invitation of the Venezuelan government. A  highlight of the Panama summit involved U.S.-Cuban efforts to normalize relations. Kerry said Tuesday that Washington’s efforts to re-establish ties with Havana were not a “leap of faith” but the best way to promote U.S. interests and values while helping Cubans achieve greater freedom and opportunities. Kerry hailed the change in U.S. policy toward Cuba and cooperation in education, energy and trade with other Latin American countries as "a transformative moment for the Americas." "We are determined to deliver on the strategic and historic opportunities that together we can create," he said. Kerry said he and Obama met for hours with their Cuban counterparts in Panama, in the first such formal meetings since the 1950s. Cuban President Raul Castro told Obama that he was prepared to discuss a number of contentious issues, including human rights and press freedom. He acknowledged areas of continued disagreement and said resolving those matters would take time. The U.S.-Cuba talks in Panama drew fierce criticism from some U.S. lawmakers and other political figures who accused Obama of supporting a repressive regime. "Keeping up with a disturbing trend of this administration, President Obama is in the process of striking another very bad deal, now with the communist dictatorship of Cuba," Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said in a statement following Obama''s meeting with Castro. "President Obama''s approach gives the Castros exactly what they want — economic relief and legitimacy on the international stage," said Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba. Cruz rejected Obama''s assertion that his meeting with Castro was a step toward the future. "Unfortunately," the senator said, "he is leaving the Cuban people imprisoned in the past." Obama has said the majority of Americans and Cubans support the restoration of bilateral ties.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 12:47:45 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/kerry-hails-changes-in-us-latin-american-cooperation/2728864.html\n'),
(307, '\nChileans Continue Protest Against Bishop With Links to Abuser\n', '\nParishioners in a southern Chile diocese are gathering wherever their new bishop appears, but their presence is not the sort of assembly the Catholic Church would expect. In the month since Bishop Juan Barros was installed in Osorno, the priest has had to sneak out of back exits, call on riot police to shepherd him from the city''s cathedral and coordinate movements with bodyguards and police canine units. Such is the public routine of the bishop who is denounced by his opponents as having shielded Chile''s most notorious pedophile priest. For his part, Barros said relations are improving. The appointment of Barros by Pope Francis has unleashed an unprecedented protest, with more than 1,300 church members, 30 diocesan priests and nearly half of Chile''s Parliament sending letters urging the pope to reconsider. Sex abuse accusations At least three men say Barros was present when they were sexually molested in the 1980s and 1990s by the Rev. Fernando Karadima. Karadima was sanctioned by the Vatican in 2011 for sexually abusing minors, ordered to live out his life cloistered in a nun''s convent. Barros has said he knew nothing of Karadima''s abuses. The controversy is being watched by victims, advocacy groups and lawmakers as a test of the pope''s promises to crack down on clerical sex abuse. On April 12, members on the pope''s sex abuse advisory committee traveled to Rome to voice their concerns. The pope has not spoken publicly about the case. In late March, however, the Vatican released a statement defending Barros, saying the Congregation for Bishops examined his candidacy "and did not find objective reasons to preclude the appointment." But many of the Catholic faithful in Osorno, 820 kilometers (510 miles) south of Santiago, are holding to their protest, which they say is gathering support. "We are beginning to energize our movement and make it more mainstream," said Mario Vargas, 52, a sex-abuse survivor and one of the leaders. On April 10, some 600 people protested outside the Osorno cathedral holding black umbrellas, a color they said represented the stain of sex abuse on the church. The action drew Catholic school teachers as well as community members. "New faces are joining the protests," said Juan Carlos Claret, one of the organizers. ''Good understanding'' Barros, who declined repeated requests for an interview, has said the situation has improved since his March 21 installation. He told reporters last week he had met with parishioners and priests in 10 communities and there was "a good understanding and the love of God reigns." Barros, previously chaplain of Chile''s armed forces, has celebrated Mass a half-dozen times, including during Holy Week, but parishioners say attendance is down and the bishop must travel with a police escort to keep protesters at bay. "You can feel something sour that transcends all kinds of church activities," said Carlos Meza, a 43-year-old parishioner. "It''s not just during Masses." An April 8 meeting between Barros and parishioners fell apart when the bishop showed up with two body guards and police dogs, a move the parishioners said was unnecessarily aggressive. On a video recorded at the scene and reviewed by the AP, a woman in the group is heard yelling: "We are a pacific lay movement. You can''t push us around like this." Barros joined other bishops last week at a seminary held by the Catholic University in Santiago. About 50 protesters calling for his resignation were out front, but Barros avoided them by exiting through a back door. Canon law experts say rescinding an appointment would be unprecedented, so Barros likely is there to stay unless he resigns. So far, there is no indication he plans to do so.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 03:05:03 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/chileans-continue-protest-against-bishop-with-link-to-abuser/2728311.html\n'),

Cuomo termed the agreement “courageous” in opening remarks to a business conference and said, “We want to do everything we can to help.” Cuomo was joined by top executives from JetBlue Airways, Pfizer and MasterCard, who were among 18 business leaders and academics on the trip. Cuomo said the purpose of his visit was to see what can be done now and look to the future should full trade be restored. He also mixed in some fun, drinking a mojito at the Hotel Nacional, while Cuban officials gave him what he said was his first ever Cuban cigar. Cuomo joked that if he rushed through his speech, he would have time to smoke it. As part of a deal hammered out over 18 months of secret talks, the Obama administration has loosened travel regulations, opened the door to some financial services, trade in information technology, aviation and other sectors and announced it will eliminate Cuba from the State Department''s list of state sponsors of terrorism. But the trade embargo remains largely in place and can be lifted only by the Republican-controlled Congress.

Neither has reached a deal with Cuban officials, but by Monday afternoon the delegation was in initial talks with Cubans from biotechnology, aviation, banking and tourism after lunching with the Foreign Trade and Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca. “Our meeting with Minister Malmierca was very exciting and informative,” Cuomo said. “There is much hope for the future.” The delegation was due to meet with Cuban First Vice President Miguel Diaz Canal on Monday and Cuomo is scheduled to hold a news conference on Tuesday before departing.

International Commission Against Impunity, or CICIG for its initials in Spanish, has been renewed three times and the world body would respond "favorably" to a request for another extension.   "We are ready to continue supporting Guatemala," the statement said. "From the contacts we have had with CICIG''s donors, we understand that they are also ready to continue funding the commission''s work."   Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina is expected to announce a decision on a two-year renewal of the commission''s work by the end of the month.   He has not given any indication as to what his decision will be, but recently suggested that CICIG cannot be a permanent fixture and ultimately it will be up to Guatemala to tackle powerful criminal organizations that often have tendrils reaching into government and the judicial system.   Last week authorities announced a series of raids and arrests related to an alleged customs corruption scheme believed to have bilked the state of millions of dollars.   The current and former chiefs of Guatemala''s Tax Authority were implicated in the probe, as well as Juan Carlos Monzon Rojas, the former private secretary to Guatemala''s vice president and purported ringleader of the scheme.   Monzon, 47, was said to be outside the country when the arrests were announced, and on Monday authorities said he was being sought by Interpol for suspected fraud.

"Through its work, CICIG is helping prevent Guatemalan citizens from being defrauded of funds that rightfully should be used for their benefit and not funneled into corrupt criminal networks," the statement said.

The Colombian government responded by reaffirming that it, too, was committed to the peace process, but it blamed the FARC for the renewed violence and said the rebels had lost credibility. The government and Marxist rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have been engaged in peace talks in Havana for nearly two and a half years. The negotiations suffered a setback last week when the FARC apparently broke its unilateral cease-fire, killing 11 soldiers in Colombia''s rural Cauca province. In addition, one rebel was killed and 20 government soldiers were wounded. The FARC called the combat a legitimate case of self-defense against encroaching government troops and proposed that unspecified observers investigate to determine who was at fault. The Bogota government saw it as a brazen attack on troops carrying out an anti-drugs operation in southwestern Colombia, the latest breakout of violence in a 50-year-old war that has killed at least 220,000 people and displaced millions. “We have resolved to declare a unilateral cease-fire to hostilities for an open-ended period that should transition into an armistice,” rebel commander Ivan Marquez told reporters in Havana, while warning the cease-fire could be lifted if the rebels come under attack. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has also pledged to maintain negotiations, defying calls from political opponents to suspend the peace talks. Santos''s chief negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, launched an unusually animated critique of the rebels, accusing them of violating their word on the cease-fire and repeating Santos'' claim that Colombians'' patience with them was wearing thin. “Ending the war is more imperative than ever,” de la Calle said in a statement read in Havana. The rebels called a cease-fire in December and demanded the Colombian government reciprocate. Santos refused, but in recognition of the rebel cease-fire he called off bombing raids against FARC encampments just over a month ago. That changed on Wednesday when he ordered the resumption of air raids in response to the rebel attack. “The greatest damage as been to the FARC''s credibility,” de la Calle said. “A cease-fire of this type must be serious, it must be verifiable and it has to be agreed at the table as part of the general agreement.”\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 16:40:20 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-colombias-farc-vow-maintain-cease-fire/2727385.html\n'),

(319, '\nDuke, Wisconsin to Meet for US College Basketball Title\n', '\nThe Wisconsin Badgers stunned previously undefeated Kentucky 71-64 in a tense Final Four triumph on Saturday to advance to the U.S. collegiate national championship game against Duke. "Best birthday present I''ve ever had,'''' said a celebrating Frank Kaminsky, who sparked the Badgers'' victory with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Kentucky had entered the game with a 38-0 record and were attempting to become the first team since the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers to top off a perfect season with a championship. But the underdog Badgers used a late comeback to set up their title matchup on Monday against Duke, which crushed Michigan State 81-61 in Saturday''s other Final Four game in Indianapolis. Sam Dekker, who had 16 points, hit a three-pointer for Wisconsin with less than two minutes to play to break a 60-60 tie and the Badgers never trailed again, clinching the win at the free throw line. Kari-Anthony Towns led the Kentucky with 16 but the Wildcats were uncharacteristically dominated inside where Wisconsin won the rebounding battle 34-22. Wisconsin will be going for their first national championship since 1941. They lost to Duke earlier this season in a regular season clash. Justise Winslow scored 19 points, Jahlil Okafor added 18 as the Blue Devils flexed their offense against Michigan State. The victory put Duke in the collegiate championship game for the ninth time under coach Mike Krzyzewski, who won national titles in 1991, 1992, 2001 and 2010. Krzyzewski, the winningest coach in college basketball''s top level, also has coached the U.S. Olympic team to two gold medals, most recently at the 2012 London Games. Duke took control late in the first half after trailing by eight points early. They led 36-25 at halftime before racing to a 20-point advantage in the second half. Denzel Valentine Jr. scored a game-high 22 points for Michigan State.\n', 'Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:56:25 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/us-college-basketball/2707289.html\n'),
(320, 'Amy Winehouse Talks About Fear of Fame in Biopic', '\nA new documentary on the life of late British singer Amy Winehouse shows the six-time Grammy-Award winner in her younger days discussing her misgivings about fame, a preview of the trailer showed on Thursday. Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning nearly four years ago at her London home at the age of 27 after struggling with drinking and drug problems throughout much of her career. "I don''t think I''m going to be at all famous, I don''t think I could handle it. I would probably go mad," Winehouse says in the first glimpse of "AMY," due for release on July 3 and using previously unseen footage and unheard tracks. Directed by Asif Kapadia, who won a BAFTA for his documentary "Senna" on the late Formula One racing driver Ayrton Senna, AMY features footage of a young Winehouse singing and smiling to camera and talking about her career while a version of her hit "Back to Black" plays in the background. Seen as one of the most talented musicians of her generation, Winehouse''s albums - with songs such as "Valerie," "You Know I''m No Good" and "Rehab" - sold in their millions. "I never thought ...

(323, '\nWith a Wink to ''Twilight,'' Kristen Stewart Speeds Forward\n', '\nIn "The Clouds of Sils Maria,'''' Kristen Stewart''s celebrity has been inverted. The paparazzi rush right past her.   She plays the efficient, constantly emailing assistant to Juliette Binoche''s famed European actress. Reading tabloid stories about a Hollywood starlet (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), she shrugs: ''It''s celebrity news. It''s fun.'''' When she''s running through possible roles for her boss, the former "Twilight'''' star describes one film as having werewolves "for some reason.''''   "I had to seriously harness the glee that was exploding across my face when I was saying some of those lines,'''' Stewart said in an interview. "I don''t think that''s what the movie is fully about. It''s not a commentary about the insane nature of the media in the States, especially. But no one knows about that more than me.''''   Stewart, 24, doesn''t seem so much like she''s fleeing her teen idol past as she''s already long gone, maybe just glancing back, with a wink. "The Clouds of Sils Maria,'''' directed by French filmmaker Olivier Assayas ("Carlos,'''' "Summer Hours''''), which opens in theaters April 10, is part of a string of recent and upcoming films Stewart has made in a headlong rush.   " I''m having more fun now than I ever have,'''' says Stewart. "These movies go by (she snaps her fingers). We made ''Camp X-Ray'' in 20 days. It''s just better when it''s faster.''''   The frenetic pace is in stark contrast to the plodding demands of a five-film franchise like "Twilight.'''' The movies now are largely independent, and the roles (like in "Sils Maria'''') are often supporting or part of an ensemble. She co-starred as Julianne Moore''s daughter in "Still Alice'''' and played a Guantanamo guard in "Camp X-Ray.'''' She''s completed a science-fiction romance ("Equals''''), a stoner thriller ("American Ultra'''') and a New York mugging drama ("Anesthesia''''). She''s been filming Kelly Reichardt''s adaptation of Maile Meloy short stories, and she''s to co-star in Woody Allen''s next film.   "Because of the lack of expectation of any of these movies, there were no moments that people had read in a book that were the most important thing in their lives,'''' she says, referring to her "Twilight'''' role. "I really let go.''''   Shew adds she''s "gotten a lot better at trusting myself and not thinking that you need to use these nerves and crazy inertia to convince everyone on the set that you''re legitimate.''''   Stewart''s post-"Twilight'''' work reveals (or perhaps reminds) that her nature is less as a megawatt star than an actress bent on naturalism, instinct and inquisitiveness. She has basically returned to making much the same kind of indies she made outside of "Twilight'''': "Adventureland,'''' "Welcome to the Rileys,'''' "The Runaways.'''' There''s a distinct lack of preciousness in choosing projects or any evident career-building.   ``All my favorite actors are not people that go off and make these characters that are iron-clad perfect,'''' Stewart says. "I want to see people willing to go places they''re not determining. You want to see the surprise in people''s faces.''''   Assayas approached Stewart for "Clouds of Sils Maria'''' on the suggestion of producer Charles Gillibert, who had worked with Stewart on the Jack Kerouac adaption "On the Road,'''' also a French production. Stewart says she never got the script ("and in their very French way they didn''t call or ask or push''''), so the role was cast for Mia Wasikowska. After Wasikowska dropped out, Stewart came aboard.   "It''s really something that you have not seen her in,'''' Assayas said at the Cannes Film Festival, where the film first premiered. "Kristen, whatever image one has of her, ultimately she''s just a great actress by any standard.''''   She has certainly won the French over. In February, she became the first American actress to ever win a Cesar, France''s top film award, for her performance in "Clouds of Sils Maria.''''   Of the actor-publicist relationship Stewart says: "It''s always more complicated than: ''Go get me water.'''''' Though she''s playing a character on the opposite side of fame, it may be the role closest to Stewart herself.   "It''s so not a departure. It''s a world that I know so well and that I''ve observed so much of,'''' Stewart says. "I really wasn''t trying to be anyone else.''''   In person, Stewart seems to physically shrink, balled up in a defensive pose, her sleeves pulled over her hands. She never exactly loosens up, but she''s animated when talking about her inspirations and her newfound creative freedom.   When asked about how "Twilight'''' changed her, Stewart rambles reluctantly on how it helped her realize she''s an actor. But when it''s pointed out that it sounds like "Twilight'''' is far from her thoughts, she quickly nods.   "Completely. I only have to think about that when someone asks me.''''\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 13:34:18 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/with-a-wink-to-twilight-kristen-steward-speeds-forward/2705808.html\n'),

(325, 'Russian Pop Groups Seek US Audience', '\nMusical groups from more than 50 countries played at the 2015 South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas last month, including two groups from Russia, Mumiy Troll and Pompeya, that represented two different approaches to attracting an American pop music fan base. Both are looking beyond Russia for commercial success. The group Mumiy Troll hails from the Pacific coast city of Vladivostok, and its musical influences come from rock, electronic dance music, and Japanese punk. Growing up in the port city, lead singer Ilya Lagutenko said he spent a lot of time tuning in music from nearby Japan and even U.S. military stations. “Whatever you heard influenced you immediately because it was not what you heard on the local radio,” he said. He writes the songs he sings, but he said that whether singing in English or Russian, what really matters is how the music connects with people. “Show me one person who would understand lyrics from day one when you hear it on stage. Sometimes you feel the energy, that is why you like it, so we are trying to combine both,” said Lagutenko. The group Pompeya has a completely different sound, influenced heavily by western pop music from 30 years ago, according to lead singer Daniil Brod. “It is new wave with a little bit of funk and disco,” said Brod. Pompeya is from Moscow, but, in the past few years, they have spent a lot of time traveling outside of Russia, especially in the United States. They rented an apartment for their stay in Austin so that they could feel more at home. “We really enjoy the traveling; we travel and we introduce our music to the people,” said Brod. Keyboard player Sasha Lipskiy said Russians sometimes show up for their shows in cities like New York, but the audience is still 90 percent Americans or people from other ethnic groups. “That is really good because we intend to be an international band, not a band for Russian immigrants,” he said. Through concerts and online videos, Pompeya has attracted fans in this country as well as other parts of the world. Daniil Brod says the group has many teenage fans in Russia, but in the U.S. it tends to be people in their forties who listened to this style of music when they were young. “Those people are older than we and they say, ‘Wow, you are playing the music from my teenage years,’” said Brod. Pompeya’s latest album, called Real, will be released next month.\n', 'Thu, 02 Apr 2015 23:14:05 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/russian-pop-groups-seek-us-audience/2705186.html\n'),

Other highlights included Humphrey Bogart''s Hartmann ''Turn Table'' steamer trunk that fetched $47,500 and a granite and wrought iron games table that brought in $26,250.

John Mayall, Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie were together for just three months that year as part of Mayall''s Bluesbreakers band. The music was recorded in five clubs in and around London, including The Marquee and The Ram Jam. It is, for blues aficionados, an immersion into musical history. And it sounds like a 1960s live electric blues performance should: rough, echoey, raw. The four musicians all went on to various degrees of fame. Mayall is still an active blues man at 81, the "godfather" of the British electric blues that swept the country in the 1960s and helped promote it beyond its black roots base back in the United States. At various times and in various incarnations, his band has featured Cream''s Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, The Rolling Stones'' Mick Taylor, Canned Heat''s Harvey Mandel, and ubiquitous drummer Aynsley Dunbar. Green, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, is considered one of the world''s great electric guitarists. He dropped out of sight for a number of years with mental illness before re-emerging with various bands. His song "Black Magic Woman" was a global hit for Latin rocker Santana. Bassist McVie and drummer Fleetwood formed Fleetwood Mac, at first a blues band with Green, then later with a new line-up one of the most successful pop-rock groups of all time. The new release - "John Mayall''s Blues Breakers - Live In 1967" - was restored by Forty Below Records. It is suitably basic and the company admits it is "certainly not hi-fidelity." Among the more interesting tracks are "I Can''t Quit You Baby", a Willie Dixon song that later graced Led Zeppelin''s debut album. There is also a rollicking version of "Hi Heel Sneakers" and a leisurely "Stormy Monday" along with 10 other tracks. The album is to be released on April 20 in Britain and April 21 in the United States.

(329, '\nSquare-Dancing Grannies Get Regulated Dance Moves in China\n', '\nIn a move aimed at ending a surprising public conflict, China has decided its square-dancing grandmothers need some oversight of their surprisingly controversial pastime. Sports officials in Beijing have announced 12 new choreographed routines, created by an expert panel, to help grannies learn how to dance properly. It is common in many Chinese cities for large groups of older women to go to a local park after dinner for organized square dancing to loud music. But many of their neighbors are frequently disturbed by the noise. So the government has decided to intervene, implementing government-sanctioned routines and setting new rules about dancing times and music volume. The decision has sparked conflicting reactions. One online commenter wrote, “Do we need to remember Chairman Mao’s words before dancing?”  Another asked, “Is the State General Administration of Sports crazy? People have a right to dance. Why are they regulating dancing?” But others had a more favorable view of the new rules. “I felt like this thing is good. Experts have more knowledge about the proper fitness method. And it will have the opposite effect if they did not exercise in a right way," one commenter wrote.   Many of the grannies also seem to like the new dance regulations. One elderly lady on a Beijing dance team said that it is a "good thing if there is a standard choreographed dance.” She added that she would try almost all the dances that are "suitable" for her age. But she complained that her group would need to buy instructions for the new routines. She called upon the government to make the new dance moves freely available to the public.

(331, 'After 20 Years, New Asian-American Comedy on US TV', '\nIt’s been two decades since a major American network television show featured Asian-American characters. Margaret Cho’s situation-comedy, “All-American Girl,” about a Korean-American punk-rock teenager and her conservative immigrant family was canceled in 1995 after just one season. So it’s not surprising that Asian-American viewers have responded with excitement to “Fresh Off the Boat,” a new sitcom on the ABC network. Set in the mid-1990s, the show begins as 11-year-old Eddie Huang''s Taiwanese-American family - father, mother, younger brothers and grandmother - move from Washington, DC’s Chinatown to Orlando, Florida. Eddie’s father, played by Randall Park, has bought a steakhouse, and his mother, played by Constance Wu, sets about becoming a real estate agent. Orlando is an alien, almost all-white culture, and the Huangs meet both awkward friendliness and blunt prejudice - both played mostly for laughs. Eddie, played by Hudson Yang, has to cope with being different in a new, mostly white school.  Other kids are disgusted by his Chinese food lunches, so he switches to what they eat - sandwiches prepackaged in plastic.  He loves hip-hop and identifies with black pop culture, but doesn’t fit in with African-American kids, either.  A black classmate pushes him aside in the cafeteria, and calls him by the racial slur “chink.” “Get used to it,” he barks at Eddie, “You’re the one at the bottom now.” To Herb Tam and his friends, who’ve been gathering to watch the show every week at a restaurant in New York’s Chinatown, “Fresh Off the Boat” is a defining event.  Tam, the curator at New York’s Museum of Chinese in America, compares it to the moment when Chinese-American basketball player Jeremy Lin vaulted to fame.   “We all thought it was a big, important moment in Asian-American history, as far as we’ve been around,” he said. “That sense of elation that one of us had finally made it onto this big stage, that there was this depiction of Asian-American life that resonated not just with us, but clearly with non-Asians, too.  It’s this sense that we’ve been isolated and that people don’t get us that’s finally been alleviated in this one arena.” His friend, City Council employee Vincent Fang, calls it a rebirth. “Asian-Americans have always played a supporting role on TV, but they have never been the main characters, and this is just one of those -- it’s iconic, and I think that it’s a moment for our community to shine, for us to see one of our own on TV,” he said. “Fresh Off the Boat” is based on a much rawer, angrier memoir by Taiwanese-American celebrity chef Eddie Huang, about his experiences growing up in Orlando.  His parents were far stricter, even harsh, and he learned to fight at an early age.  Initially, Huang objected to the watering down of his story in “Fresh Off the Boat,” which he narrates in voiceover as the grown up Eddie, comparing it to sickly sweet Chinese-American food calibrated for white, middle American tastes. He refused, as he wrote in a New York magazine essay, to read a line in which Eddie was supposed to say, “America IS great!” Ultimately, he rewrote the line to, “America ain’t three-fifths bad,” referring to the fraction of personhood that the U.S. Constitution assigned to black slaves. “Randall was neutered, Constance was exoticized, and Young Eddie was urbanized,” Huang wrote of the show, saying it feeds the “pathogenic stereotypes that still define us.” When Huang saw the first episode, with the defining “chink” insult uttered at Eddie in the cafeteria, he changed his mind. “I felt some truth in it for those three minutes,” he wrote, calling them the “holy trinity” of everything Asian-Americans had sacrificed for in order to gain a voice in American culture - even one that is only now beginning to be heard. Vincent Fang and Herb Tam said they also initially feared that the show would neuter Asian-American experiences. “I was worried they would get it wrong, that the accents wouldn’t be faithful, that they would reinforce stereotypes,” Tam said.  “But after the first episodes, it was clear that the writing, the production, the acting was quite strong, and did in many ways a really good job of representing a certain kind of Asian-American experience.  Most importantly, it was funny, and I think the show will live and die on whether it’s actually funny and entertaining.” “I think it allows all of America to see that we are like them, we’re not just the Kung Fu master or the geeky [socially inept] guy who wins the math contest, but we’re well rounded characters,” Fang said.  “You know, Eddie has the same childhood as the kid who lived down the block.  And I think the show also does a good job of showing the subtle racism that a lot of Asian-Americans grow up feeling and experiencing.  I certainly felt it when I was growing up.  I certainly had people use the word ''chink'' on me.” “I would like to see more "controversial moments,” Fang said, but added, “I understand why it has to be watered down so it is acceptable, so that not just Asian-Americans will watch it, so the rest of America will, too.” More than enough Americans, of whatever ethnicity, do seem to be watching. For many weeks, “Fresh Off the Boat” has been the most popular network show in its time slot, pretty much guaranteeing that it will be renewed for next year.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 19:22:02 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/after-20-years-new-asian-american-comedy-on-american-tv/2703568.html\n'),

Construction work is underway and the $400 million Museum of the Bible is scheduled to open in 2017 in a location surrounded by federal government buildings and just blocks from the U.S. Capitol. That has led critics to doubt Green’s and other benefactors’ motives. “There’s no question that if you want to build a museum to the Bible, to the Quran, any building at all, and someone is willing to sell you the property, you have the right to buy it in this country," said Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. But he suspects the project is part of an effort to infuse government with conservative Christian values. “I can’t believe that the people who created the Bible Museum wanted this to be anywhere but close to the center of power,” Lynn said. Washington may be the center of American political power, but it is also home to some of the nation’s most visited museums, and that was the reason Washington was chosen, said Museum of the Bible President Cary Summers. He said the history of scripture will be presented in a non-denominational way through multimedia exhibits, ancient Torah scrolls, parchments from the New Testament and other items from the Green collection. “We’re trying to be as academically correct, as non-biased as we can, and as non-sectarian as we can,” Summers said. When it opens, the Museum of the Bible will be as large as some of the Smithsonian museums just two blocks away on the National Mall. Asked at a press conference whether he hoped the Bible museum might bring people to Christianity, Steve Green said: “We would hope people would consider what the book has to say and that’s a choice that they make. And if it’s compelling, then that is a decision they can make on their own,” he said. “But we believe it’s something that everybody ought to consider.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:31:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/bible-museum-coming-to-washington/2730683.html\n'),
(339, '\nActor Ben Affleck: ''Embarrassed'' by Slave-owning Ancestor\n', '\nActor Ben Affleck said Tuesday he regretted asking a PBS documentary show profiling his ancestors to exclude a relative who''d owned slaves, saying he was embarrassed by the revelation. Affleck''s ancestry was traced by Harvard scholar Henry Louis (Skip) Gates Jr. for an episode in the second season of "Finding Your Roots." In the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) series, well-known personalities can discover more about their family history. "I didn''t want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth," Affleck said in a statement on his Facebook page. "I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story," he added. Representatives for PBS and Gates did not respond to requests for comment. The issue came to light after anti-secrecy website Wikileaks released a searchable database of more than 30,000 documents that were stolen by hacker from Sony Corp''s Sony Pictures Entertainment in a massive cyber attack last year. Affleck said in his statement that Gates had final say in what was included in the episode, which aired last October. He said he had "lobbied" Gates on what elements of his family history to use in the show. The Oscar-winning actor-director added that he assumed the show "will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family." "While I don''t like that the guy is an ancestor, I am happy that aspect of our country''s history is being talked about," he said.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 01:45:22 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/actor-ben-affleck-embarrassed-by-slave-owning-ancestor/2729762.html\n'),
(340, '\nOnline Handcraft-Seller Etsy Has Unprecedented IPO Success\n', '\nA U.S.-based online handcrafts and antiques seller has had unprecedented success since it went public last week. Although Etsy''s stock prices have declined since the initial excitement, the New-York based start-up is showing resilience.   Etsy is an online marketplace offering handmade, antique and vintage goods sold by individual sellers. Since its inception a decade ago, the firm has built a solid base of about 1.5 million active sellers and close to 20 million buyers. Its revenue has grown steadily, reaching more than $195 million last year. As of December, the Etsy app had been downloaded 22 million times. Kathleen Smith, whose company, Renaissance Capital, tracks IPOs and developments in the market, said Etsy "is a leading online operator of handmade and vintage goods, including jewelry, furniture, clothing. No other company has been able to create this kind of community. And it''s a very loyal community. Mostly women. And in the prospectus, they will tell you that about half of the buyers and sellers in 2011 were buyers and sellers in 2014." Initial success a surprise Still, Etsy''s initial stock market success surprised everyone. Its shares opened at $31 on April 16, the day the company made its Nasdaq debut, and climbed above $35 during the day, more than double the firm''s initial public offering (IPO) price of $16. Called the largest IPO ever for a venture-backed, New York-based start-up, Etsy sold more than 13 million shares, raising $267 million on the day it went public. Smith said, "The company has really increased its spending on marketing, figuring that it has such a loyal client base that it''s worth paying more to keep attracting  clients. The growth rate is pretty good, over 50 percent at the end of the year and its looks like they can get this 30 percent type of growth." After the initial stock market hype, Etsy''s stock prices went down, sparking predictions that it will be sold. Liana Baker, a correspondent who covers mergers and acquisitions for Reuters news service, said, "I think, with Etsy coming out and the valuation in the low billions, it could make it ripe for picking by a bigger company like eBay or Amazon." But as of Tuesday, the company''s stock had recorded a slight increase, ending at $25 per share. Market analysts said it is not yet clear what Etsy''s future will be.   "That is going to depend on how management treats its new investors and delivers the kinds of expectation that investors are expecting," Smith said.    Founded in 2005, Etsy has grown from a website selling just wooden objects to an online community of crafters offering unique goods that cannot be mass produced or re-sold. Its supporters view it as an antidote to global mass production and consumption, pushed by big corporations. Veering from that path could turn off the company''s loyal base. But Etsy has announced plans to grow globally and expand its base of buyers and sellers of one-of-a-kind items.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 01:12:12 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/online-handcraft-seller-etsy-has-unprecedented-ipo/2729753.html\n'),

(342, 'Rare Marilyn Monroe Photos Go on Display in Poland', '\nPictures of Marilyn Monroe by fashion and celebrity photographer Milton H. Greene will go on display in the Polish city of Wroclaw this summer as part of a rare collection of prints of the U.S. actress. The western Polish city successfully bid for the pictures at an auction last year for 6.4 million zloty ($1.69 million) according to local media, and the collection is likely to become a major attraction to Wroclaw, which is due to be one of two European capitals of culture in 2016. It is made up of more than 3,000 prints and also includes pictures of other actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich. The pictures are taken on movie sets, in theaters, during magazine photo sessions and in private settings. A preview of 47 pictures of Monroe, including “Ballerina Sitting”, was unveiled to art and photograph critics on Tuesday while the exhibition, entitled “Good day, Marilyn”, opens to the public in July. “A person walking through the exhibition should be able to see a different Marilyn Monroe on every photograph because these are photographs of an actress and movie star but also a private person,” said exhibition curator Marek Stanielewicz. “Some photographs were posed but some show Marilyn Monroe in intimate situations. The key thing was to show Marilyn Monroe not only as a great actress and sex symbol but Marilyn Monroe as a human and a girl.” Greene, who worked for magazines such as Harper''s Bazaar and Vogue, became friends with Monroe after they met on a photo shoot. They later formed a production company and Monroe eventually moved in with the photographer and his family, where he took numerous photographs of her. Greene died in 1985. Poland obtained the pictures as part of a settlement in an embezzlement case involving a U.S. businessman in the 1990s. A first batch of pictures of Monroe was auctioned in 2012.

(343, '\nPulitzer-Winning Music a Tribute to Pennsylvania Coal Miners\n', '\nJulia Wolfe descended hundreds of feet underground, into a dank, dark cavern with gleaming black walls: a Pennsylvania coal mine.   "You can''t believe people spent all day there," Wolfe recalled Tuesday. "It was spooky, a little bit, but so fascinating, a strange kind of beauty."   Wolfe''s visit helped inspire "Anthracite Fields," a choral tribute to the state''s mining heritage — and, now, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in music. The judges described her work as a "powerful oratorio for chorus and sextet evoking Pennsylvania coal-mining life around the turn of the 20th century.''''   "I''m a little stunned," Wolfe, a music professor at New York University, said a day after her win. "I''m enjoying it, having a good time."   Commissioned by the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia, a choral group, "Anthracite Fields" recalls the hard work and sacrifice of generations of anthracite coal miners, whose toil yielded fuel for the Industrial Revolution and heat for cities and towns up and down the Eastern Seaboard.   "I wanted to show the life and understand it from different angles," Wolfe said.   That life was anything but easy: Tens of thousands of miners perished underground, and those who survived often developed black lung disease and other chronic conditions. The first movement of "Anthracite Fields" is a haunting litany of names — all with the first name of John — of those who died in mining accidents. An ode to the "breaker boys" follows, young boys hired to pick rock from coal inside gigantic processing facilities called breakers.   Wolfe, a native of the Philadelphia suburb of Montgomeryville who has lived in New York City for more than 30 years, was only vaguely aware of this history when she began her research.   She pored over books about anthracite mining. She became obsessed with ghostly, century-old photos of the breaker boys. She visited defunct coal mines in Scranton and Lansford — both of which now operate as tourist attractions — and spoke with former miners and their families.   One of her conversations, with Barbara Powell, the daughter and granddaughter of miners, led to a movement called "Flowers," a tribute to the women of the coal fields.   "We were poor, so our homes were just basic," Powell, who works at Scranton''s Anthracite Heritage Museum, told The Associated Press. "We did our yards up with flowers, and it made everything look so warm and inviting."   Powell and her husband attended the April 2014 premiere of "Anthracite Fields," performed by the Mendelssohn Club and the Bang on a Can All-Stars in Philadelphia, and came away moved. She said Wolfe — and the performers and production designers who helped bring "Anthracite Fields" to life — got it exactly right.   "It was just so captivating," Powell said. "It did a lot for our heritage here in northeastern Pennsylvania.''''\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 19:00:17 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/pulitzer-prize-music-tribute-to-pennsylvania-coal-miners/2729642.html\n'),
(344, 'Paris Concert Hall Plays a Different Tune', '\nThe Parc de la Villette was packed on a recent afternoon. Women in West African boubous pushed baby carriages. A group of Chinese practiced dance moves. Young families and Frisbee players caught a few rays of spring sunshine. Giant slaughterhouses stood here a century ago. Today, La Villette is an arts and science center located on edge of northeastern Paris. Ringed by highways and working-class neighborhoods, it’s a green oasis that bursts with every color of France’s ethnic rainbow. Rap and world music stars perform at La Villette. But the park’s latest addition is playing a different tune, one that’s usually associated with the city’s more elegant neighborhoods. The new Philharmonic complex opened its doors in January. Designed by star architect Jean Nouvel, it’s a massive, glittering showcase of cutting-edge sound and design that now houses the Paris symphony orchestra. Perhaps more importantly, the Philharmonie de Paris is a bold, social experiment. The aim, says President Laurent Bayle, is to sell classical music to a younger, poorer and much more culturally diverse audience. "Generally, our model embraces two dimensions," Bayle says, "to shine internationally and to act locally." Headline-grabbing project The Philharmonic captured the spotlight long before its debut. The $417 million, publicly financed project was plagued by funding disputes and construction delays. When it finally opened January 14, a week after the January terrorist attacks in Paris, the building still wasn’t finished – and architect Nouvel boycotted the inaugural gala. Last week, he lost a legal battle to force construction changes; he’d contended his original design had been sabotaged. Today, the Philharmonie faces a bigger challenge; skeptics wonder how it can succeed when concert halls are closing across Europe. But Bayle dismisses his critics with a smile. "French will say no, because French hate success," he says. "But those who fought us without stop over the past years now leave me in peace." To be sure, the massive building seems to offer something for just about everybody. A current exhibit features pop star David Bowie. There are also classrooms where the general public can learn to play an array of musical instruments at low cost. Lessons start at about eight euros an hour. "The basis of this project is simple: that music should be accessible to everybody in the simplest of conditions," says Philharmonie spokesman Philippe Provensal, who toured reporters around one recent afternoon. "It''s not necessary to have years of training to touch an instrument. We give the instrument directly to a person and the basic instructions on how to play it." Target audiences within sight The top floor offers a magnificent view – not of Paris, but of the gritty suburbs surrounding it. Reaching out to their inhabitants is a goal of the Philharmonie. It’s not only offering cheap tickets for performances, but it’s also setting up children’s orchestras in ethnically mixed and less affluent neighborhoods. "We’re offering a mix of different activities to generate a larger audience and my goal is to reach a split between Paris and the surburbs," says Bayle, the Philharmonie president. But, he adds, "I never thought our first victory would in the poorest and most difficult areas. There are inequalities that only the law can change." Interviews around La Villette suggest Bayle’s ambitions may not seem so far-fetched. "I''ve heard a bit of classical music before – stuff like Beethhoven and Bach," says teenager Aymeric Makwanza, who hails from the town of Chelsea. It’s the kind of gritty suburb the Philharmonie is targeting. "I hear there’s a theater or opera inside. Hearing a concerto or something like that wouldn’t be so bad." Intimate concert hall St. Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra played at the Philharmonie’s concert hall one recent evening. Shaped like a giant bowl, it seats 2,400 people. But the feeling is intimate. Every seat, no matter how cheap, has a good view. Its acoustics were designed by the Marshall Day Acoustics team.   "The hall is magnificent and the music is extraordinary," says Parisian Myriam Netter, attending a concert here for the first time. Of the Philharmonie’s ambitions of tapping a wider audience, she adds, "I absolutely agree with them. Otherwise, classical music will die out." So far, the Philharmonie is enjoying sell-out performances. But as the novelty fades, skeptics suggest its traditional, and more affluent, audiences may think twice before heading to this working-class neighborhood. Bayle disagrees. Other bold projects – such as the modern arts Pompidou Center – faced similar criticism, he pointed out. In the end, they''ve found success.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:01:25 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/paris-concert-hall-plays-a-different-tune/2728666.html\n'),
(345, '\nAC/DC Drummer Pleads Guilty to Threatening to Kill Ex-Employee\n', '\nThe veteran drummer for the legendary rock band AC/DC pleaded guilty Tuesday in a New Zealand court to threatening to kill an ex-employee. Phil Rudd faces up to seven years in prison for the charge, which his lawyer said related to an "angry phone call" made last year. The 60-year-old Rudd also admitted to two less serious charges of possessing marijuana and methamphetamine. Rudd, who was arrested last November, initially denied all charges against him, but unexpectedly pleaded guilty during the hearing in Tauranga. Court records show the dispute began in August, when Rudd became unhappy with several people, including the victim, at an event during which his solo album was released. Four weeks later, Rudd called an associate and told him he wanted the victim "taken out." In exchange, he allegedly offered the associate $153,000, a motorbike, and one of his cars or a house. Rudd is also said to have later called the victim directly and told him "I''m going to come over and kill you." Drugs found When police raided Rudd''s home, they found nearly half a gram of methamphetamine and 91 grams of cannabis. Prosecutors had originally charged Rudd with more serious murder-for-hire charges, but dropped them because of a lack of evidence. His lawyer, Craig Tuck, said he will seek a solution, known as a discharge without conviction, that will have minimal legal consequences. Rudd was released on bail. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for late June. The Australia-born Rudd, who now lives in New Zealand, left AC/DC in 1983, but rejoined the band in 1994. He is not taking part in the band''s world tour that starts next month. AC/DC is one of the highest-grossing bands of all-time, with hit songs that include "Back in Black," "Thunderstruck" and "You Shook Me All Night Long."\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 00:14:43 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/acdc-drummer-pleads-guilty-to-threatening-to-kill-ex-employee/2728267.html\n'),
(346, '\nBible Stories, Thrillers Make Morocco a Top Filming Choice\n', '\n"QUIET!" The cry rings out in English, French and Arabic across the cobblestoned streets of Jerusalem, as filming begins for a scene in the series "A.D. The Bible Continues."   But while the arched doorways, balconies and furnishings all say Roman-era Israel, the real-life setting is southern Morocco.   Viewers in America and elsewhere in the world may not know it but they have seen a lot of Morocco in the past year. It has served as the Baghdad of "American Sniper," the Tehran seen in TV series "Homeland," the Mali of "American Odyssey" and the Egypt that will appear in the miniseries "King Tut." Morocco has also been Somalia numerous times, including in the 2001 film "Blackhawk Down," and more recently in the 2013 "Captain Philips." And it will be Saudi Arabia in this year''s "Hologram for a King" starring Tom Hanks.   All in all, it has been a banner year for Morocco''s status as a gigantic film-set - with $120 million spent by foreign film productions in the country last year, more than in the past five years put together.   The North African kingdom is riding high on its reputation for stability and exotic locales, but industry officials say that Morocco needs to do more - and offer more incentives - to realize its potential as a filming destination. It is contending with increasingly stiff competition from South Africa and other countries that offer deep tax rebates. For Morocco''s film industry, the future depends on the right package of sweeteners to persuade studios to do more than just film exteriors here but also use local facilities. The ultimate goal is to get Hollywood to film entire movies in Morocco, said Sarim Fassi-Fihri, head of the Moroccan Center for Cinematography, which oversees the industry.   "The day tax incentives come to Morocco, the whole industry will move here," he said, cutting a cinematic figure himself, sporting a fedora and puffing on a cigar. "If we make $120 million today, with tax incentives we could go up to $200-$250 million."   He pulled out a sheaf of publicity brochures from competitors in Turkey, Colombia, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Ireland, even the Canadian province of Manitoba, with promised tax rebates of 20-40 percent plastered across the covers to entice film companies.   Ever since 1962, when David Lean filmed scenes from "Lawrence of Arabia" in Morocco, film companies have been using its deserts, mountains and cities as stand-ins for exotic locations. At the vast Atlas Studios complex in Ouarzazate - Morocco''s desert Hollywood perched between the High Atlas and the Sahara - there are sets from dozens of movies from the past decades.   Here, it''s possible to ride the camel used by Nicole Kidman in the upcoming "Queen of the Desert" past the pharaonic sets from 2002 French film "Asterix and Obelix Meet Cleopatra" to the fortifications Ridley Scott built to recreate medieval Jerusalem for the 2005 crusader film "Kingdom of Heaven." Morocco has fallen in and out of fashion as a movie set over the decades. One mainstay has been biblical films, and that business is booming now with the bible-craze taking off in America. At one point over the winter, there were three actors playing Jesus in different productions staying at the main hotel in Ouarzazate. The new boom comes off some lean years, beginning with the 2008 global financial crisis and exacerbated by the 2011 Arab Spring unrest that led insurers to pull film companies out of the Middle East. But in the case of Morocco, they came back.   Morocco stands out for being blessed with the people and landscapes needed to satisfy renewed interest in the Middle East, while having none of the agitation common elsewhere.   "The Arab Spring did help us, actually, when everyone was more worried to come to Tunisia and everywhere else, they were coming to Morocco because it was a lot safer," said Khadija Alami, head of one of Morocco''s several local production companies that partner with international companies.   Alami first worked on the 1985 Chevy Case comedy "Spies like Us," soon followed by "Ishtar," before founding her own production company in 1998. It organizes crews, permissions and filming locations for shoots.   The industry has also been boosted by official support. While the state has yet to approve tax rebates, it does make it easy to work in Morocco and is happy to lend the services of the Moroccan army for a reasonable fee.   Aside from the helicopters, the military equipment used in "Blackhawk Down" largely came from the Moroccan army. Soldiers also often play extras when huge crowd scenes are called for.   The government even allowed the main highway between Marrakech and the seaside town of Agadir to be closed for three weeks last year for "Mission Impossible 5." Local media later credited the closure for a drug bust - when a car full of cocaine ran afoul of a police checkpoint in the detour.   Most important is Morocco''s reputation for tolerance regarding themes other Muslim countries might find unpalatable. Biblical stories are out of the question in some conservative countries and the current vogue for thrillers set in the Middle East is too political for many Islamic countries.   "There is a big boom here because of its nature as the most liberal of the Muslim countries," said Eamon Patrick, a line producer for "A.D."   "So any filming that uses a contemporary Middle East setting, they do a lot of it here," Patrick said.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:05:58 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/bible-stories-and-thrillers-make-morocco-a-top-filming-choice/2728155.html\n'),
(347, '\nDirector Peter Jackson Unveils WWI Exhibition in New Zealand\n', '\nTaking a break from filmmaking, Peter Jackson has created a museum exhibition he hopes will broaden people''s perception of World War I from monochrome to color.   The first stage of the Great War Exhibition he unveiled last week in Wellington features large color images depicting life in the trenches and on the battlefields. The color was added to real black-and-white photographs by artists at Jackson''s visual-effects studio, Weta Digital.   Jackson said he banned black-and-white in the museum because the photography of the era means people tend to perceive the war in monochrome.   "I just wanted people to be able to see the war in color, as the soldiers saw it," Jackson said. "If you take a black-and-white photo and do a really great colorizing job on it, you see detail. You see it''s emotional. It actually has a power that really takes you by surprise."   A World War I history buff, Jackson has been working on the museum for the past few months after finishing his trilogy "The Hobbit." He owns a number of planes and artifacts from the era, some of which he has donated to the collection.   He plans to periodically open new galleries to coincide with the centenary of particular battles, starting with a Gallipoli battle exhibit on April 25.   Jackson, 53, said he''s been interested in World War I since he was a child, when he would hear stories about his grandfather and great-uncles, who fought in the war, and see movies about it like "All Quiet on the Western Front."   He said in the exhibition he aims to take people on a journey through the war, along the way describing anecdotes. Like, for instance, how the British code name for a secret vehicle has now became part of our everyday lexicon: tank.   "The one thing I think I''m quite good at doing is telling a story," he said. "I didn''t want to tell a bunch of facts. Boring, historical, schoolbook facts."   He said he wanted people to come away thinking about the folly of the war but also how brave the fighters were.   "It was a hopeless war, it was a war for no reason," Jackson said. "At no point was anybody fighting for anything that really meant anything. There was no Hitler, there were no Nazis or Holocaust that had to be beaten."   He said he''s also fascinated by the push for technological advances during the war, which began with soldiers on horses and ended with them in planes.   "The mechanization we know of in the 20th century was born in this war," he said.   The exhibition has so far received about 12 million New Zealand dollars ($9.2 million) in funding from public and private sources, with organizers hoping that amount will grow. Jackson has been given creative control and donated his time and resources.   The exhibition will be free to the public.   Jackson has been working on an extended cut of his final "Hobbit" film but hasn''t announced plans for any future movies.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:45:19 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/director-peter-jackson-unveils-wwi-exhibition-in-new-zealand/2728164.html\n');

(350, '\nRingo Starr, Green Day Rock Their Way into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n', '\nRingo Starr was ushered into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a little help from one of his famous friends. The mop-topped drummer who kept the beat for the Beatles, Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist on Saturday night during a ceremony jammed with scintillating performances and touching moments. Starr was the last of the Beatles to be inducted for his individual work, getting in after bandmates Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison. He was always the fourth Beatle - John, Paul, George ... and Ringo - but now he''s been immortalized as a frontman. Starr was inducted along with Green Day, underground-icon Lou Reed, Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, soul singer-songwriter Bill Withers, guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and The "5" Royales. The 74-year-old Starr was inducted by McCartney, and then stepped to the podium and said: "My name is Ringo and I play drums" as if anyone didn''t know. He was then joined on stage by Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh on "It Don''t Come Easy" before McCartney came out to play bass, the two living Beatles jamming again, to "A Little Help From My Friends." With plenty of punk attitude and energy, Green Day thrashed its way into the Rock Hall. The Bay Area trio, which formed as teenagers and helped make punk rock radio friendly in the 1990s, briefly turned the star-studded event into one of their high-intensity shows with a powerful set of some of their most memorable hits. From the opening power chords of "American Idiot," Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool had the crowd at Cleveland''s Public Hall dancing in the aisles. Brash and belligerent, Green Day blasted onto the music scene just as Seattle''s grunge sound was growing stale. The band borrowed riffs from punk pioneers like The Stooges and Sex Pistols, flavored them with some power chords and pop hooks and helped redefine a genre. Reed was both daring and provocative as a songwriter and lyricist, pushing boundaries with ballads about forbidden subjects like drugs, prostitution and suicide. Reed''s songs like "Walk On The Wild Side," "Vicious" and "Heroin" remain vibrant today. Although he died in 2013, Reed continues to influence a young generation of musicians touched by his rebel ways. Patti Smith remembered Reed the poet and recalled being at Rockaway Beach when she got the news of his death. She rode the subway back to New York City, Reed''s city. "People were crying on the street," Smith said. "You could hear his voice coming out of cafes. Everyone was playing his music. Strangers came up to me and hugged me. It was as if the whole city was mourning. ... Thank you, Lou, for brutally and benevolently injecting poetry into your music." Withers was inexplicably left off the hall''s ballot for years, perhaps an unfortunate oversight. But the 76-year-old, who walked away from the music industry in the 1980s, is now part of musical royalty with a catalog of timeless songs like "Lean On Me." And "Just The Two Of Us." During his induction speech, Wonder said he would often hear Withers'' music and say, "I wish I could have written that song." Wonder performed "Ain''t No Sunshine" with Withers sitting next to him on stage enjoying every second. Withers, who has rarely performed in public over the past three decades, then helped sing the "Lean On Me" chorus with John Legend. Jett couldn''t keep her rough rocker edge for long. After being introduced, Jett, the black-leathered girl you might not bring home to meet your mom, was moved to tears. "I tried not to cry and be tough," she said, her black mascara starting to run. Jett opened the show with a rip-roaring version of "Bad Reputation" and was joined by Foo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl for a blistering "Cherry Bomb," one of her hits with The Runaways, a band that broke down barriers for women in rock. "I come from a place where rock and roll means something," Jett said. "It''s more than music, more than fashion, more than a pose. It''s a subculture of rebellion, frustration, alienation and the groove." Sadly, Vaughan died in 1990 at the height of his blossoming career in a helicopter crash. Armed with his signature Stratocaster, the Texas bluesman was an unstoppable force on six strings. John Mayer called it the "honor of a lifetime" to induct Vaughan, whom he called "the ultimate guitar hero." "Stevie used his guitar to lead him out of town," said Mayer, who later traded licks on "Texas Flood" with Gary Clark Jr. "He gave me hope because heroes give you hope. While Jimi Hendrix came down from outer space, Stevie came up from below the ground." HBO will broadcast the event on May 30.\n', 'Sun, 19 Apr 2015 07:51:15 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-ringo-starr-green-day-rock-their-way-into-rock-hall/2725590.html\n'),
(351, '\nEarth Day Concert, Rally Draws Thousands in Washington\n', '\nAn all-day Earth Day rally and concert Saturday drew some big names to the National Mall in Washington and into the world of politics to confront the dual issues of climate change and poverty. Usher, Mary J. Blige, Gwen Stefani, Common, Fall Out Boy and Train performed at the free Global Citizen 2015 Earth Day rally hosted by rapper/entrepreneur will.i.am and journalist Soledad O''Brien. The event drew a crowd of thousands near the Washington Monument. The rally is a joint initiative with the Global Poverty Project, which is live-streaming the event, to end extreme poverty. Organizers are seeking to highlight the problems of poverty and climate change around the world. They are also encouraging participants to commit to making environmentally friendly "acts of green" this year, and asking attendees to sign petitions for a U.N. conference on climate change planned for Paris in December. "Whether it''s the big migrations we expect to see or soil depletion or emptying the oceans, loss of species, loss of timberland — all these things are creating poverty at the same time that they are also creating climate change issues," said Kathleen Rogers, Earth Day Network president. “Eliminating poverty will require solving climate change.” U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, actor Don Cheadle and Coldplay''s Chris Martin addressed the attendees. Usher performed on crutches because of a fractured foot but drew big cheers, singing his hits "Yeah!'''' and "OMG'''' and teaming up with Common to sing the beginning of "Glory,'''' the Oscar-winning song from the movie "Selma.'''' "To end poverty, it starts, in my opinion, with an education about it,'''' Usher told the crowd. "I want you to go and investigate for yourself so that you can really understand what''s going on.'''' Backstage before his performance, Train frontman Patrick Monahan said he didn''t know much before about the environmental movement and the push to end extreme poverty. But now he wants to stay involved permanently. "It''s about all of us being aware but getting our hands dirty, because it''s not going to be an easy thing,'''' Monahan said. ``Whatever I can do to help legislation change, which is a humongous thing, and to get dollars to go to different places.'''' Monahan said he''s been inspired by the charitable work of Coldplay''s Martin and Hugh Evans of the Global Poverty Project, which has set a goal to end extreme poverty by 2030. Earth Day organizers also announced plans with developers of the popular "Angry Birds" game to create a new in-game experience about climate change. "Angry Birds" has been downloaded 2.8 billion times worldwide. The game''s climate change campaign will coincide with the U.N. General Assembly in September as world leaders tackle sustainability goals. Earth Day is officially observed on April 22. This year marks Earth Day''s 45th anniversary. Earlier, President Barack Obama said in his weekly address that there is "no greater threat to our planet than climate change." "Climate change can no longer be denied or ignored," with 14 of the 15 hottest years on record happening in the first 15 years of this century, he said.  Last year was the warmest recorded year.  The Earth''s rising temperatures are having "very serious implications," the president said, including stronger storms, deeper droughts and longer wildfire seasons.   The U.S. leader said he would observe Earth Day on Wednesday at Florida''s Everglades, a location he described as "one of the most special places in our country" and "one of the most fragile." He said rising sea levels are putting the "national treasure" at risk.  The world is looking to the U.S. to take a leadership role in dealing intelligently with climate change, Obama said. "And that''s what we''re doing," he said, adding that America is using more clean energy than ever before and is number one in wind power use. He said other measures taken include an increasing number of energy-efficient cars and buildings that save consumers money.

(352, '\nSurprise Hungarian Combo Creates World of Shifting Rhythm\n', '\nIt sounds like the musical equivalent of Hungarian goulash: Take the gypsy fiddles of a leading folk band, blend them with the drums, bells and xylophones of the country''s top percussion ensemble, then stir and season to taste. No one knew quite what to expect from the first joint concert of folk group Muzsikas and globe-trotting rhythm specialists Amadinda, but Thursday night''s outing at the Budapest Palace of Culture turned out to be a spicy musical treat. Both groups have international reputations, with Muzsikas, formed in the 1970s, famed for its versions of traditional Carpathian folk music, for which it won the prestigious WOMAD world music award in 2008. Amadinda, founded a decade later, is renowned for its interpretations of John Cage, Steve Reich and Gyorgy Ligeti. They had never played together until this week when, after what Muzsikas co-founder Daniel Hamar and Amadinda''s Zoltan Racz said was years of admiring each other''s work from a distance, they brought the two ensembles, plus a pair of traditional Hungarian folk dancers, together as part of the Budapest Spring Festival. The stage was crammed with the fruits of Amadinda''s travels — from a Fang wood xylophone from Gabon and a Magogodo gourd from Malawi to a Buddhist temple bell from Japan that produced a haunting drone. Added to the mix were Muzsikas'' gypsy fiddles and double bass, plus the ever-surprising “utogardon” that looks like a small cello and is beaten with drumsticks. If there was any doubt a group like Amadinda, which produced a six-CD set of Cage''s percussion works, could mesh with a group specializing in folk tunes that have been around for hundreds of years, it was quickly dispelled. The common ground is rhythm — the complex patterns of the music from Africa, Bali, Tahiti and elsewhere that Amadinda has worked into its repertoire, but also the ever-shifting beat of the tunes that Muzsikas plays, the same ones that inspired composers Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly a century ago. This concert turned out to be practically a love fest of diverse cultures. Amadinda would play an African- or Polynesian-inspired piece that, more often than not, worked up to tempos so fast their drumsticks became a blur of white. Muzsikas would follow with something deceptively gentle, like a warm bath, but which soon turned into a whirlpool of shifting rhythms. The evening began and ended with Amadinda''s Aurel Hollo hunched around a temple bell, which sprang into musical life to emit an ethereal buzzing sound at the touch of a brush he swept around its rim. The sound faded slowly into silence after all the musicians, including Hollo, had left the stage at the end of a concert that at least some would have wanted to go on all night.

Malaysian lawmakers said the government needs The Prevention of Terrorism Act, that was approved Tuesday, to counter the threat posed by Islamic militants in Malaysia. Human Rights Watch called the new law "a giant step backwards for human rights in Malaysia" and warned it was a revival of the Internal Security Act that was repealed in 2012. "By restoring indefinite detention without trial, Malaysia has re-opened Pandora''s Box for politically motivated, abusive state actions that many had thought was closed when the abusive Internal Security Act was revoked in 2012," Human Rights Watch''s deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said in a statement. Malaysia''s upper house of parliament and the king are expected to back the measure, allowing it to become law.

(354, '\nAmnesty International Raises New Warnings on Afghan Women’s Rights\n', '\nThe international human rights group Amnesty International says the Afghan government is doing nothing to stop a trend of escalating violence, sexual assaults and assassinations targeting women human rights activists in the country. “While Taliban are responsible for the majority of attacks against women defenders, government officials or powerful local commanders with the authorities’ backing are increasingly implicated in violence and threats against women,” says Amnesty International in a report titled Their Lives On The Line, launched in Kabul Tuesday. Those facing threats and violence range from rights activists, politicians, lawyers, journalists, teachers. Even women in the police force are under threat, where sexual harassment and bullying is rife and almost always goes unpunished, the report says. It says that international governments have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into projects supporting women’s rights since 2001 but the approach has not gone far enough. Amnesty International says its researchers interviewed more than 50 women defenders and their family members across the country and found a consistent pattern of authorities ignoring or refusing to take seriously threats against women. It went on to assert that few investigations were carried out, while prosecutions and convictions were even rarer. In many cases, women defenders who reported violence or attacks were put at further risk, facing stigmatization or threats simply for speaking out. “Rights defenders have suffered car bombings, grenade attacks on homes, killing of family members and targeted assassinations. Many continue their work despite suffering multiple attacks, in the full knowledge that no action will be taken against the perpetrators,” the report read. "It’s outrageous that Afghan authorities are leaving them to fend for themselves, with their situation more dangerous than ever," the report quotes Salil Shetty, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, as saying. “With the [international] troop withdrawal nearly complete, too many in the international community seem happy to sweep Afghanistan under the carpet. We cannot simply abandon this country and those who put their lives on the line for human rights, including women’s rights.” The group’s Afghanistan Researcher, Horia Mosadiq, told VOA they have held meetings with President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah to inform them of the dangerous situation facing women rights defenders but have yet to see any concrete measures to protect those who have bravely fought for the significant gains Afghanistan has made in recent years.

The official Xinhua news agency said strong tremors were felt up to 50 kilometers (30 miles) away. Authorities deployed 177 fire trucks and 829 firefighters to fight the blaze and all nearby residents were evacuated, Zhang said. The fire was under control, and authorities were monitoring the environment for any contamination, Zhang said. The plant attracted protests even before it was built.

The ministry summoned Japan''s ambassador in Seoul to complain about the textbooks, which were approved by Tokyo on Monday. A statement by the South Korean foreign ministry on Tuesday said Japan''s decision describes "hard historical facts in a way that they are distorted, understated, and/or omitted." South Korea says the islands -- known as Dokdo to South Koreans but Takeshima to Japanese -- are "unequivocally an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Korea in terms of history, geography, and international law." The statement said Japan''s refusal to change the wording in the textbooks indicates its intent to repeat past wrongdoings. Tokyo said all textbooks will refer to the islands as part of Japan''s territory. Japan occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to the end of World War II in 1945.

(358, '\nAnalysis: Several Factors Motivate Saudi Outreach to Pakistan\n', '\nSaudi Arabia’s bid to get Pakistani military support for the Saudi-led effort against Houthi rebels in Yemen is designed to “scare” the Iranians, says Charles Schmitz, an analyst at the Middle East Institute.   Schmitz says Pakistan would be a much greater threat to Iran than the Saudis are.  He said bringing Pakistan in “increases the pressure on the Iranians,” who are backing the Houthi rebels.   “The Pakistanis are very effective. They are militarily accomplished,” said Schmitz. “They are trained and disciplined and “battle-ready units,” he said.   Saudi Arabia Steps Up After Yemen Spins into Chaos   A Saudi-led regional coalition began launching airstrikes against the Houthi rebels last month. The rebels seized control of the capital, Sana’a, in September. They began marching on the southern city of Aden last month.   Yemen’s U.S.-backed leader, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, left the country last month and went to Riyadh.   The Pakistani parliament is considering the Saudi request to provide ground troops as well as air and naval support.   The country’s defense minister, Khwaja Muhammad Asif, told parliament on Monday that the country’s decision would “reflect the wishes of the people of Pakistan.”   “I want to reiterate that Pakistan has pledged to defend the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia and, if needed, Pakistan will fulfill this pledge,” he added.   U.S. Takes Neutral Stance   At the U.S. State Department, spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to weigh in on whether Pakistani involvement would be beneficial or destabilizing.   “Every country can make their own decisions about whether to join these kinds of efforts. The same goes for the Pakistanis,” said Harf.   Several Motives Behind Saudi Request   Nabeel Khoury, an analyst at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center does not think Pakistani involvement would be destabilizing. But he says adding Pakistan would be “overkill.”   “All [of] these countries that Saudi Arabia is adding have a more sophisticated military, specifically the Arab countries of Morocco, Jordan and Egypt,” said Khouri.   He said there are other motives behind Saudi Arabia’s decision to reach out to Pakistan.   Saudi Arabia has extended financial assistance to Pakistan to help with its troubled economy. Also, the Saudi royal family provided shelter to Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif after he was ousted in a 1999 military coup.   “Riyadh likes to keep Pakistan on tap,” said Khouri. “They have a special relationship,” he said.   But Schmitz says Saudi Arabia’s decision to try to engage Pakistan may be more of a reflection of its concern about widening Iranian influence in the region.   He said Saudi Arabia is concerned that the nuclear talks that are under way between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany could lead to rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran.   Schmitz said the Saudis are clearly worried about this possible outcome.   He said the Saudi decision to lead the regional coalition fight against the Iran-backed Houthis is a “Saudi defense pact.”   “It is a means for them to assert their ability to defend themselves without the United States, and to not take directions from the United States,” he said.   The U.S. has not indicated that a nuclear deal with Iran would lead to closer engagement with Tehran on other issues.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 19:02:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/saudi-arabaia-strongly-motivated-to-reach-out-to-pakistan/2709297.html\n'),

Citing a South Korean government source, the Yonhap News Agency Monday reported North Korea has designated a no-sail and no-flight zone for its ships and aircraft off the east coast. The news agency also said a mobile missile launcher loaded with Rodong, a ballistic missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers, has been partially spotted along the country’s east coast. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the communist country has not given notice of plans for a test launch. “We have confirmed that North Korea has not notified our government or the International Maritime Organization of the no-sail and no-fly zone designation,” said Defense Ministry Vice Spokesman Na Seung-yong. Regarding the report of the mobile missile launcher, Na said South Korea and the U.S. are watching North Korea’s military activities closely. Some analysts in Seoul said Pyongyang could tie the timing of a missile launch to Carter’s visit or the April 15 birthday of the country’s founder, the late Kim Il Sung. “Since a tentative nuclear deal was reached between the U.S. and Iran, North Korea could be [Washington''s] next negotiating partner. The Rodong is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, and the North could test-fire the missile to demonstrate its will that it will never stop developing its nuclear program,” said Shin In-kyun, a military analyst with the Korea Defense Network.

India, the world''s No.3 emitter of greenhouse gasses, has come under pressure to tackle its rapidly rising emissions since the United States and China committed last November to start cutting their own emissions after a “peak year”. United Nations climate talks will be held in Paris later this year to look at ways to limit a damaging rise in global temperatures. Getting India to agree to a strategy to lower its own emissions is vital if the talks are to be judged a success. “The world guides us on climate change and we follow them? The world sets the parameters and we follow them? It is not like that,” Modi said at an event in Delhi. “We can lead the world.” The Indian government has said it needs to emit more to industrialize and lift millions out of poverty. While Modi has in the past highlighted the dangers posed by climate change, he has also argued that the world must focus more on clean energy and less on outright emission cuts. India has set an ambitious target to raise renewable energy generation but is also expanding the mining of coal, a major contributor to its growing emissions. On Monday, Modi suggested using traditional methods such as switching off street lights on full-moon nights to save on energy and cut emissions. Modi also accused the world of double standards by lecturing India about the environment but refusing to sell it the fuel needed for nuclear power. Some countries maintain a ban on selling uranium to India because New Delhi has refused to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

(368, '\nIndonesian Court Rejects Australian Death Row Appeal\n', '\nAn Indonesian court rejected on Monday a last-ditch challenge by two Australian drug convicts facing execution by firing squad, but lawyers for the state and defense were divided over whether legal avenues remained for them to avoid the death penalty. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were convicted in 2006 as the ringleaders of a plot to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia. They had both challenged the Jakarta administrative court''s decision not to hear an appeal against President Joko Widodo''s refusal to grant them clemency. “There is no more legal recourse,” Novarida, head of the state lawyers team, told reporters after the verdicts were delivered drily in a court packed with lawyers and journalists. However, the convicts'' lawyer said they would take their case to the constitutional court. “They have the right to live, and the state attorney knows that [the law] allows them to defend their lives,” Leonard Arpan told reporters. The Australian pair are among 10 drug convicts due to be executed by firing squad on the prison island of Nusakambangan. Others in the group include citizens of France, Brazil, the Philippines, Ghana, Nigeria and Indonesia. Widodo denied clemency to the convicts despite repeated pleas from Australia, Brazil and France. Calls for Mercy Rebuffed Sukumaran and Chan had sought in February to challenge the president''s blanket rejection, with their lawyers arguing that he did not give due consideration to each case. But the administrative court originally dismissed their case on the grounds it did not have the legal authority to assess it. The attorney general is awaiting the outcome of legal appeals by three remaining death row inmates before setting a date for executions. His office''s spokesman has previously said the intention is for all the executions to be carried out together, but they could be conducted in batches. Indonesia has harsh penalties for drug trafficking and resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year gap. Widodo has pledged no mercy for drug offenders, saying Indonesia faces a “drug emergency.” The country is a major destination for drugs trafficked in the region. Australia has made repeated calls for mercy on behalf of Sukumaran and Chan, but Widodo has refused to change his stand, turning down an offer of a one-off prisoner exchange and to have the Australian government bear the cost of the convicts serving life sentences. “Where there is life there is hope,” Mercy Campaign, a group collecting signatures for a petition to Widodo, said on its Facebook page after the latest ruling. “We will continue to respectfully ask the president to change his mind.” Sukumaran and Chan were identified as leaders of a group of nine Australians arrested on the resort island of Bali in 2005 and convicted of attempting to smuggle some 18 lb (8 kg) of heroin to Australia. Other members of the group have been sentenced to long prison terms.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 03:07:38 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-indonesian-court-rejects-appeal-by-australian-death-row-convict/2708099.html\n'),
(369, '\nBangladesh Opposition Leader Granted Bail in Graft Cases\n', '\nBangladesh''s former premier and main opposition leader Khaleda Zia was granted bail in two graft cases on Sunday after she appeared before a special court, a potential sign of easing tension in the politically unstable South Asian country. Zia appeared amid tight security before a special anti-graft court in the capital, Dhaka, to request bail more than a month after warrants for her arrest were issued, her lawyers said. Zia''s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has intensified protests this year in a bid to force Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and hold a new vote under a neutral caretaker administration after a disputed 2014 poll. The BNP refused to take part in the 2014 general election, saying it was rigged. Zia''s lawyer, Sanaullah Miah, told reporters she had been unable to appear for previous court hearings "or health and security reasons." Her next court appearance was set for May 5. The 69-year-old former leader has been staying in her office in Dhaka''s diplomatic enclave since she was prevented from holding a mass rally on January 5, the first anniversary of the disputed election. Zia waved to dozens of chanting supporters as she left the court to return to her home. The court''s decision to grant her bail could be a sign of easing tension. Political violence More than 120 people have been killed and hundreds injured in political violence, most in petrol bomb attacks on vehicles, amid transport blockades and strikes by the opposition aimed at toppling the government. Political unrest over the past three months cost at least 49 billion taka ($630 million) or 0.55 percent of the country''s gross domestic products, Center for Policy Dialogue, a leading private think-tank, said on Sunday. It said it had analyzed 11 major sectors of the economy, including agriculture, transport, education and garments, which accounted for 80 percent of the country''s exports. Zia is accused of embezzling $650,000 in two corruption cases involving charitable funds during her last term as prime minister, from 2001 to 2006. She and leaders of her party have denied the charges, saying they are politically motivated. She is also facing charges of instigating the latest violence. Bangladeshi politics have been mired for years in rivalry between Hasina and Zia. Both women are related to former national leaders, and they have alternated as prime minister for most of the past two decades.\n', 'Sun, 05 Apr 2015 11:14:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-bangladesh-opposition-leader-zia-granted-bail-in-graft-cases/2707493.html\n'),
(370, '\nPhilippine Storm Maysak Fizzles, Puts Damper on Lenten Vacations\n', '\nTropical Storm Maysak weakened before hitting the Philippines'' northeastern coast Sunday, driving away thousands of Lenten holiday vacationers and tourists from beach and surfing resorts. Alexander Pama, who heads the country''s disaster-response agency, praised the public cooperation after vacationers heeded warnings and moved away from beach resorts. Maysak brought sporadic rains and whipped up waves, but no storm-related deaths have been officially declared by authorities so far. Three men separately drowned in a beach resort and a river in northern Cagayan province Friday and Saturday, according to the Office of Civil Defense, which monitors storm casualties and damage, but Pama said authorities were still trying to determine whether the deaths were caused by the then-approaching storm. One of the men apparently took part in a drinking spree before swimming in a river, where he was found dead, the Office of Civil Defense said. The two other men were swept away by strong currents. "It''s nice to say zero casualties, but it''s too early to tell," Pama told reporters. Maysak, first forecast as a supertyphoon, killed four people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Micronesia before blowing toward the Philippines, where officials mobilized to prevent a potential disaster had the storm retained its lethal power. The storm was downgraded Sunday to a tropical depression. Many Philippine TV and radio networks did not shut down as they traditionally do for the Easter holidays in the largely Roman Catholic nation to report on Maysak, which prompted officials to declare storm warnings and evacuate villagers from high-risk communities. The 120,000-strong military went on full security alert in the country''s north to brace for any contingency.

One of the people caught in the camp, who did not want to be named, told VOA''s Burmese service by phone that access to the camp, which is inside Sabaseit village, had been restricted since Tuesday. “They say they have restricted entry and exit [of the refugee camp]," he said. "For the time being, the problems the villagers are facing include the lack of access to food, fish paste and salt. They say, ''We cannot get out, and we cannot go to the market, either.'' ” A local resident who tried to help the refugees said the restricted access was creating some problems. “They do not have anything to eat anymore," he said. "They asked for help by saying that they just have rice and water to eat.” Government and military officials have not responded to VOA''s request for a comment. Reports say the restrictions are expected to be in place for five days a week, but it is unclear when they will be lifted for the first time. The situation arose following renewed fighting between the army and the Arakan Army, an ethnic rebel group that operates in Rakhine state. Rebels said the refugees came from Aung Lan Chuang, which was burned down because the military suspected the villagers of harboring rebel fighters. Colonel Nyo Tun Aung, deputy commander in chief of the Arakan Army, criticized the government for targeting civilians instead of rebel fighters. "What we can see is that, as usual, the government is destroying one thing because they cannot handle other problems," he said. It is not known how many people have been killed or wounded since the military and the Arakan rebels began fighting again in March.   The Arakan Army is one of several ethnic groups that have been fighting for decades against the Myanmar government - part of the effort to reach a nationwide cease-fire between most rebel groups and the government. Rakhine has been the site of problems involving many members of the country''s Muslim minority, who refer to themselves as Rohingya. Thousands have been displaced since 2012, when violence broke out between them and Buddhist residents of Rakhine state.

The sentencing of the prominent human rights lawyer to a lengthy prison term on Wednesday was the latest action taken by the authorities in what is widely seen as a part of repressive policies designed to suppress independent voices in Azerbaijan, analysts say.  Intigam Aliyev, the leader of the Legal Education Society, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison on charges of tax evasion, engagement in illegal business and abuse of authority. His sentencing comes less than a week after another prominent human rights activist was sentenced to six and a half  years in jail. At his sentencing,  Aliyev called the criminal charges against him to be politically motivated.  “The arrests can deprive us of our freedom, but they cannot take away our will to freedom,” Aliyev said in an emotional speech. Rasul Jafarov, founder of the Human Rights Club and the organizer of the “Sing for Democracy” campaign during the Eurovision-2012 song contest in Baku, was convicted last week on identical charges to Aliyev. On Tuesday, the Azerbaijani appellate court held a hearing on the case of Khadija Ismayilova, an RFE/RL journalist who was arrested on December 5, 2014 on a charge of driving someone to attempt suicide.  Since then, the authorities have brought additional charges that carry up to 12 years of imprisonment, if convicted.

(380, '\nRail Rivals China, Japan Compete for High-Speed Track in Asia\n', '\nIn many parts of northeast Asia and Europe train travel in the 21st century is a safe and fast cross-country mode of transport. In South and Southeast Asia, riding the rails is frequently frustrating and sometimes dangerous with derailments and fiery crashes.   China and India and Southeast Asia compromise the most populous region in the world, creating a huge potential market for modern and safe railways.   European, Canadian and South Korean manufacturers are vying for Asia’s new high-speed rail projects, but the competition is primarily between the Japanese and the upstart Chinese.   Japan had a decades-long head start, rolling out the first Shinkansen (bullet train) passenger service in 1964.   The Chinese, who sped onto the fast track in 2007, now can boast of having more than half of the world''s 23,000 kilometers of high-speed rail track. They are reported to be in talks with 15 countries to sell their rail technology. China''s first super fast trains relied on foreign technology transfers, including from Mitsubishi Electric and Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan.   The latter joint venture "produced a system that has now been effectively copied by the Chinese, adapted it in part just as the Chinese have subsumed or embraced the technologies of the Europeans and others," says Richard Lawless, the chairman of the nascent Texas Central Railroad project, which has Japanese backing. China has redesigned major components and now promotes its own rolling stock with maximum operating speeds up to 380 kilometers per hour.   Huge market for high speed rail There are many prospective and lucrative customers in Asia.   A Malaysia-Singapore high-speed line would run for 400 kilometers. It has been under discussion for nearly a decade but in the meantime the proposed budget has skyrocketed.   Vietnam''s national assembly derailed a high-speed project in 2010. But last month Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dang signaled approval for a modern north-south line for trains traveling at speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour by 2030 and a final phase completed by 2050 for speeds up to 350 kph.   Indonesia and China on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding for a high-speed rail link between Jakarta and Bandung that, according to local media, will cost $6.7 billion to construct. No new railway line has been built in Indonesia since the end of Dutch colonial rule nearly 70 years ago.   Impoverished Cambodia has contracted with the China Railway group for a 400 kilometer link between a steel facility in northern Preah Vihear province to a proposed port on southern Koh Kong that is expected to cost around $10 billion.   In India, where high-speed rail has been envisioned since the 1980''s, no train in commercial service yet exceeds 150 kilometer per hour.   Indian Railways has identified nine corridors for future high-speed passenger service.   Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who enjoys closer ties to Tokyo than Beijing, Japan seems to have the edge with a joint Indian-Japanese feasibility report scheduled for release in July. Construction is envisioned to begin in 2017 for the Mumbai-Amedabad route, costing between $11.3 billion and $12.9 billion.   No price tag has been revealed for what would be one of the more preposterous proposals: a Nepal-China rail link that, according to the China Daily newspaper, would tunnel under Mt. Everest.   Chinese financing key to deals One of the China-linked projects most likely to get rolling is in Thailand, where serious negotiations have been underway.  Proponents in Thailand note that the kingdom expends a third of its energy on transportation, but less than five percent goes to the most efficient mode: rail.   The Chinese face competition in Thailand with highly-regarded Japanese rolling stock, as well as the more utilitarian but noisier European trains, which are considered easier to maintain than Japanese-built trains.   Thailand is planning two lines of high speed trains - the one being fast-tracked for development would roll 350 km from Thailand’s northeastern to the eastern region, near the Lao border.   Beijing and Bangkok “are now thrashing out details regarding their collaboration” in constructing the standard-gauge railway, according to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.   “It''s very, very likely to get built by China, that route would be linking Thailand, Laos and Kunming,” spanning 1,200 km from inside China to the Gulf of Thailand, predicts Assistant Professor Wichai Siwakosit at Bangkok''s Kasetsart University. “The loan would be coming from China...It would cost us a lot but we need to pay it back and the tax money would get into the equation.”   The loan terms for building the network is a key part of the equation in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia. And China’s financing terms have figured prominently in negotiations. “If you come with the funding and it comes with the loan, then there''s a really, really high chance that your system will get built here,” says Wichai. China''s recent rollout of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank will "in many cases allow them to make penetrations with the lending from those institutions that they otherwise could not do," predicts Lawless.   In Thailand, rail builder shapes industry, future investment Despite the Chinese funding advantage, another Thai route is likely to be awarded to Japanese companies. It would run between Bangkok and the eastern part of Thailand, as part of an envisioned rail network to link with three other countries: Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.   “Do we really need it? Those two routes?" questions Wichai, the rail engineering program coordinator of KURAIL at Kasetsart. "We as Thai people might not need it. There are some other things that influence those two routes.”   The main beneficiary for the northeastern Thai route would be freight operators in China, who would get a new, desirable route to the sea.   The Japanese operate many factories on industrial estates in eastern Thailand.   As Thailand’s economy has slowed since last year’s military coup, the country is under pressure to attract more foreign direct investment and maintain the loyalty of existing investors. Those investors could relocate their factories elsewhere, such as Vietnam, if Thailand''s logistics infrastructure begins to lag its neighbors.   The Chinese and Japanese are also in the competition for proposed high-speed rail projects in the United States, most prominently in the two largest states -- California and Texas.   Backers in both states are weighing whether the balance should tip in favor of either China or Japan for technology and funding.   "I think on the technology, operational experience, safety side certainly it’s the Japanese. They have really an unprecedented record of operational performance and safety,” says Lawless of the Texas project.   "On the financial side, which is a critical issue, I understand, probably the Chinese would be seen to be legitimately much more aggressive, much more comprehensive in what they’re willing to do, and for that reason are making a lot of headway in a lot of countries," he says.   Another challenge the Chinese face in Asia and America is convincing buyers they can offer a reliable single integrated system even if the price tag is cheaper.   "If they adopt one country’s rolling stock system, for example, another country’s infrastructure system, and yet a third country’s control system or signaling system you have to make sure that these are integrated into a proven, single integrated system," explains Lawless. "That’s been a real challenge for the Chinese, particularly when they take foreign systems, overlay them with Chinese fixes or ''improvements'' if you will, and then attempt to make that back into an entire system."   China’s rail industry looks overseas to keep momentum China appears compelled to export its technology, after years of fast-paced rail growth created huge construction industries based around high-speed trains.   "The Chinese market is exhausting itself with the build out that they’re currently undertaking," adds Lawless. "They have to go overseas."   Japan, faced with a declining population and China’s economic ascendance, is trying to stay in motion. It is the only country, so far, to have commercialized magnetic levitation rail technology, that this month set a new world speed record with a train that topped 600 kilometers an hour.   Central Japan Railways intends to put the maglev train into commercial passenger service between Tokyo and Nagoya in 2027.   An American billionaire entrepreneur, Elon Musk, has announced plans to leap beyond both the Chinese and Japanese maglevs with a test track for the "Hyperloop" -- containing pressurized capsules to shoot passengers to their destination at a top speed of 1,220 kph.   That is unimaginable to those lumbering at an average speed of 40 kilometer per hour on India''s Howrah-Amritsar Express, taking 37 hours to traverse the 1,600 kilometers between West Bengal and Punjab. But at least they can enjoy the view, something that will not be witnessed from the windowless Hyperloop where the scenery would pass by in a flash.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:23:03 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/rail-rivals-china-japan-compete-for-high-speed-track-in-asia/2730173.html\n'),

(382, '\nIran Seeks China''s Help to Build New Nuclear Plants\n', '\nThe framework nuclear deal between Iran and global powers has opened up new investment possibilities in an economy that has been stunted by international sanctions. Last week, a top Iranian atomic energy official said in addition to Russia, China will also help it build additional nuclear power plants. China has not commented on the proposal, but Iran says Beijing could help it build at least three nuclear plants in the coastal city Bushehr.   The city is home to Iran’s first nuclear plant, the construction of which began four decades ago.   Germany started work there in the 1970s, but that effort was halted during Iran’s Islamic Revolution. After that, Russia took over in the 1990s, but it was not until 2013 the plant was operating at full capacity.   Oil-rich Iran says it needs nuclear power to meet its energy needs. Uranium fuels nuclear reactors, but can also be used to make nuclear bombs. Iran and world powers are seeking to reach final agreement on a deal by late June.   Chinese expertise China Center for Energy Economic Research at Xiamen University Director Lin Boqiang says China is well positioned to be a key player in Iran’s nuclear energy program.   Lin says, “China has great strength when it comes to the construction of power plants, given that most of the new plants being built in the world today are in China.” He says “the export of nuclear energy is also something that is essential to the transitioning of the Chinese economy.”   Late last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time approved a Chinese-designed reactor, giving it the green light for domestic production as well as exports.   Last week, the Chinese government approved the construction of the country’s first third-generation nuclear reactor, the Hualong One.   China is trying to build up its own brand of reactors, says Matthew Cottee, a research analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Program.   “The Hualong One is currently being built in China, but it is going to take a while for the international community to have some trust in a new nuclear reactor that has not been built anywhere else,” he said.   Analysts say that first reactor could take six to eight years to build, but China is already exporting the technology abroad.   Chinese media say a power station under development in Karachi, Pakistan could be the first Hualong One built outside China, and Argentina also has agreed on a deal to build one in the South American country. Beijing also has a bilateral deal with Romania and a potential deal with Turkey.   Possible joint ventures If China carries through on building reactors in Iran, it could partner with another foreign country to mitigate the political risk of such a sensitive project.   “Whether China will be the only country in such a cooperation or whether the Chinese involvement in such nuclear power construction will be in kind of a like a consortium, such as a French company for example, is not yet clear,” said Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies.   China is already eyeing multi-nation deals to help it break into lucrative foreign markets that could be wary of partnering solely with Beijing.   Analyst Matthew Cottee points to a nuclear power project in Britain that may use Chinese financial backing and French designs.   “If the reactor is built at Hinckley Point in Somerset in the U.K. that will be potentially involving some Chinese funding. But if you look at the memorandum of understanding between the U.K. and China, it kind of paves the way for a potential Chinese indigenous technology to actually be constructed in the U.K.,” said Cottee.   On Tuesday, President Barack Obama proposed a 30-year agreement to cooperate with China on nuclear power. If approved by the U.S. Congress, the deal would allow the transfer of material, reactors, components and technology between the two countries.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:02:00 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/iran-seeks-china-help-to-build-new-nuclear-plants/2730146.html\n'),
(383, 'Rights Group Slams Bangladesh’s Garment Industry', '\nHuman Rights Watch has slammed Bangladesh’s garment industry for using anti-union tactics to stifle efforts by workers to form unions. A new report calls on the government and Western retailers to do more to protect workers rights in the country’s flourishing garment sector, which came under the international spotlight for lack of safety following a disastrous collapse of a factory two years ago.  Threats, verbal assault, physical abuse, unpaid wages and dismissal are some tactics used by some factory owners to push back against unions in Bangladesh’s garment industry, according to the report titled “Whoever Raises Their Heads Suffers the Most”  which was released on Wednesday in Dhaka by Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Phil Robertson.   The report says a larger number of unions have been registered following labor law reform to boost workers rights in the wake of the deadly building collapse that killed more than 1100 garment workers in the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka two years ago.   But Robertson cites many instances of retaliation against workers trying to form unions.   “These crackdowns involve not only verbal harassment, and intimidation, but in some cases significant and serious instances of abuse," he said. "We have stories of a union president being beaten in the factory… We have thugs being hired by factory owners to follow people, we have cases of sexual harassment where supervisors basically attack workers verbally.”   The HRW report also cites forced overtime, denial of paid maternity leave, and failure to pay wages and bonuses on time, or in full as some of the intimidating tactics faced by those organizing or joining unions.   It says workers also face poor working conditions.   The report is based on interviews with 160 workers from 44 factories making garments for retailers in North America, Europe and Australia.   It underlines the need for unions in the industry, pointing out that a union in the Rana Plaza factory would have helped reluctant employees fend off demands by managers to continue work in the building which had developed major cracks.   The Rana Plaza collapse raised an international outcry and prompted initiatives for a safety overhaul in Bangladesh’s garment factories.   But Robertson says if Bangladesh wants to avoid a similar disaster, it must effectively implement labor laws.   “That is going to have to involve workers voices because workers are on the frontline of workers safety issues," Robertson said. "These are the people who are being injured by unsafe factories and factory fires or factory collapses. To leave them out of the equation, to try to silence them when they assert their rights betrays the spirit of accountability.”   The rights body says factory owners have rejected allegations of intimidation against labor leaders.   It says an official of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association told the rights body that, “We have a bitter experience about unions.

(384, '\nIndonesian General Gets No. 2 Police Job Despite Graft Scandal\n', '\nThree-star general Budi Gunawan was quietly sworn in as Indonesia''s No. 2 police officer on Wednesday, two months after being dropped by the president for the top job due to his implication in a bribery scandal. The politically connected general was initially chosen by President Joko Widodo to lead the police, but his name was eventually withdrawn in February after weeks of public outcry. Gunawan has maintained his innocence in the bribery case, and the case against him was eventually dropped by Indonesia''s main anti-graft agency. Widodo''s anti-graft credentials — which helped bring him to power six months ago — were dented by the controversy, and his weeks of dithering raised questions about his readiness to take on vested interests in Southeast Asia''s largest economy. The president eventually chose Badrodin Haiti as police chief, who in turn picked Gunawan to be his deputy soon after being inaugurated earlier this month. “The inauguration of Budi Gunawan has started according to our tradition,” said police spokesman Anton Charliyan. “The meeting to decide the candidate was a secret, the appointment itself is called a secret telegram, so I hope you can respect that.” The inauguration was closed to the media and occurred as attention focused on an Asia-Africa summit in the capital. Gunawan is close to Megawati Sukarnoputri, former president and leader of Widodo''s political party, and many consider the appointment a political maneuver aimed at appeasing the president''s patron. Anti-graft activists said Gunawan''s appointment reflected badly on the president and raised questions about much-needed reforms of the police, one of Indonesia''s most corrupt public institutions. “We talked about getting people to invest in Indonesia ... but how are people supposed to feel comfortable investing when there is a police force and a judiciary with such little credibility?” said Natalia Soebagjo, board member of Transparency International.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 08:48:26 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/indonesian-general-gets-no-2-jobs-despite-graft-scandal/2729964.html\n'),
(386, '\nAustralia Makes Video Pitch for Cambodia to Asylum Seekers\n', '\nThe Australian immigration minister on Wednesday made a blunt videotaped pitch to asylum seekers detained on the Pacific island of Nauru to accept a resettlement offer while stressing they should forget about ever moving to Australia. “I want to make it very clear to all refugees and transferees in Nauru that you will not, under any circumstances, be settling in Australia. This is not an option that the Australian government will ever present to you,” said Peter Dutton, the immigration minister in the video message. Cambodia has agreed to take more than 1,000 refugees in exchange for what is described as a $30 million aid package from Australia. The agreement has been criticized by numerous rights workers who contend it contravenes the United Nations Refugee Convention. “The government of Cambodia has made it clear to Australia that it wants this arrangement to succeed,” said Dutton in his taped remarks to the refugees. “It sees great value in refugee settlement and welcomes the experience and energy you can offer to its nation.” The immigration minister touts Cambodia as offering the refugees a “wealth of opportunities,” describing the impoverished Southeast Asian nation as fast-paced, vibrant and diverse. In reality, Khmers compose 90 percent of the population of 15.5 million people, while half of the remaining ten percent of those living in Cambodia are ethnically Vietnamese. Ninety-seven percent of the people in Cambodia are Buddhist. More than 700 asylum seekers held in Nauru are from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Nearly 500 have been deemed to be genuine refugees, more than 80 have had their claims rejected and another 150 have yet to be assessed. It had been anticipated that the first refugees would move to Cambodia by the end of last year, but they have been reluctant. Relectant candidates A refugee advocate on Monday said five asylum seekers - described as three ethnic Tamils from Sri Lanka, a Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar (also known as Burma) and an Iranian — have agreed to be among the first to accept the Cambodian offer. Tension has been high in the Australian-run detention center where there has been sporadic rioting. A fire during a violent protest in 2013 destroyed all the accommodation blocks, medical facilities and offices. Dutton in his videotaped appeal noted the ongoing resistance, saying “please do not let the behavior of these agitators ruin this opportunity for you.” The Refugee Action Coalition, an Australian-based rights group, says asylum seekers are being offered between $7,800 and $11,700 to go to Cambodia. Nearly two dozen current and former medical staff, teachers, social workers and other employees of the detention center have signed an open letter calling for all of the asylum seekers to be permitted to go to Australia to protect them amid widespread physical and sexual abuse. Tightening asylum policies Australia has significantly toughened its asylum policies in recent years. It now tries to return boats to the point of origin if they are carrying people not authorized to enter the country or sends them to the remote detention camps on Nauru or Papua New Guinea. “Stopping the boats” was a centerpiece of Prime Minister Tony Abbott''s 2013 successful election campaign. But Australia''s stance has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks, by both supporters and opponents of hardline policies on maritime migration, in wake of the surge of deaths by those seeking to cross the Mediterranean from Africa to Europe. Australia appears to be having no change of heart, however. Australian immigration officials last week evaluated and rejected the asylum claims of 46 Vietnamese aboard an Australia navy vessel before all were sent back to Vietnam, according to Fairfax Media. “The reports are extremely concerning and represent a fundamental violation of refugee rights by the Australian government,” said Amnesty International refugee campaign coordinate Graeme McGregor. Prime Minister Abbott, for his part, believes European countries should follow Australia''s lead. "We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe," Abbott told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the "only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:49:28 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/australia-makes-video-pitch-for-cambodia-to-asylum-seekers/2729837.html\n'),
(388, '\nUS Envoy: Iran Nuclear Talks Prove US Willing to Engage N. Korea\n', '\nThe U.S. envoy to the moribund six-party talks on North Korea’s nuclear program said progress in negotiations with Iran clearly demonstrates a U.S. willingness to negotiate a resolution of the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang (DPRK). Speaking Tuesday at the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), U.S. envoy Sydney Seiler said the North Korean leadership faces two choices: the path to denuclearization and prosperity or its current approach of ignoring its international obligations and deepening isolation.   He said Washington has left the door of negotiation open to Pyongyang six years after the North Koreans walked out of the talks with the United States, Japan, South Korea, Russia and China in 2009. "Progress in our nuclear talks with Iran clearly demonstrates our willingness to engages countries with whom the United States has had longstanding differences," he said. "And there should be no doubt we remain committed to negotiations and a negotiated resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue on the basis of the 2005 Joint Statement of the six-party talks the fundamental roadmap for achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." Pursuit of nuclear weapons In that 2005 statement, Pyongyang agreed to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons but has since violated it with three nuclear detonations and engaged in missile launches prompting U.N. Security Council sanctions. Seiler said North Korea’s obfuscation and recalcitrance has not deterred U.S. efforts to pursue denuclearization. He said, aside from keeping the diplomatic door open to the North, U.S. policy seeks close cooperation with allies South Korea and Japan, as well as engaging China, with which Washington has shared goals. "China seeks peace and stability in Northeast Asia. So do we. China seeks denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as a foundation upon which lasting peace and stability is truly obtainable. So do we," he said. "China understands the economic benefits of a peaceful and stable Korean peninsula. So do we.  And, as a path to these broader goals, China seeks a return of North Korea to authentic and credible denuclearization negotiations. So do we," Seiler added. He said he remains optimistic about the long-term prospect of a denuclearized Korean peninsula because of improving South Korean/China relations. The U.S. envoy also said the cases of Cuba, Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Iran underscore the willingness, flexibility and creativity the United States can show when it has a credible dialogue partner. "Skeptics could argue that the jury’s out, but, in any case, we had three instances where a country responded to our offer to reach out a hand to those who would unclench their fist," Seiler said. He said the international community is looking for this type of policy shift in Pyongyang and it would be positively responded to. But, Seiler said it appears the North has not learned anything from the Iran negotiations. Nuclear arsenal Korean scholar Sung-Yoon Lee of Tufts University said North Korea is unwilling to give up its nuclear arsenal. "Very few, if any, nuclear weapons-possessing states have such intentions and, in history, only four nations with a nuclear arsenal have given them up and, in all those cases, there was a change in the leadership," Lee said. "North Korea is a family dynasty that has been in place for the past six decades, and I would go out on a limb and say Iran has learned the lessons observing North Korea over the past 20 years. You sign on to an agreement, you pledge denuclearization and, in return, get concessions, lifting of sanctions or more aid, or what have you, and then you stall and see the agreement break down and then you demand new concessions, more concessions and, usually, the bigger powers follow suit," he added. Lee said, even if six-party talks were revived, North Korea’s leadership has a compelling interest to maintain its nuclear arsenal. Otherwise, it risks, over time, being absorbed into unification with South Korea.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 04:58:53 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/us-envoy-iran-nuclear-talks-prove-us-willingness-to-engage-north-korea/2729801.html\n'),

Abe was away from his office at the time, attending a conference in Indonesia. No injuries or damage was reported. The drone was about 50 centimeters (1.7 feet) in diameter, had four propellers, and carried a small camera and a plastic bottle with unidentified contents, Tokyo police said. The bottle, they said, was believed to be the source of radioactive cesium contamination. The drone was also decorated with a symbol that warns of radioactive material, according to national broadcaster NHK. Police said the level of radiation detected was not harmful to humans. Television footage showed dozens of police officers hovering around the drone, which was covered by a blue tarp. TV video later showed several uniformed policemen removing the drone for further examination. They did not wear protective suits as they carried the drone away in a blue plastic box. It was not clear who sent the drone or what the motive may have been. It also was not clear when the drone landed. Officials at the prime minister''s office, located in central Tokyo, said they rarely go up to the roof, which is also used as a heliport in case of an emergency.

(390, '\nTaliban Threatens to Begin Spring Attacks on Friday\n', '\nAfghanistan’s Taliban said it will unleash its “spring offensive” this Friday to intensify attacks on embassies and government facilities as well as military targets around the country. But Afghan defense ministry officials are dismissing the announcement as Taliban propaganda, saying security forces are prepared to deal with any threat. The Taliban has been waging an insurgency since it was removed from power in 2001 by Afghan and U.S.-led international forces. The insurgent group increases attacks around Afghanistan in the spring, after the snow melt, when fighters and weapons can move in the mountainous country along the porous border with Pakistan. In an announcement released to the media, including VOA, the Taliban said this year’s spring offensive has been dubbed “Azm” or “Resolution” and will begin Friday. The name resembles the NATO-led two-year Resolute Support operation that was launched in January to train and advise Afghan security forces after most foreign combat troops withdrew from Afghanistan last year. President Ashraf Ghani has been making efforts with the support of neighboring countries, including Pakistan, to open a peace dialogue with the Taliban. In recent weeks his efforts generated hopes for a peaceful end to the Afghan conflict. The Taliban, however, made no mention of a peace process. Its spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, reiterated to VOA that no talks are possible unless foreign forces completely withdraw from Afghanistan and a “sovereign government” is installed in Kabul that is “free of foreign influence.” Ghani has also been consulting members of the so-called High Peace Council his predecessor had set up to promote peace with the Taliban. Council senior member Mohammad Ismael Qasimyar responded to the Taliban announcement by urging the militants not to indulge in further bloodshed of their country men and women.    “You know killing, and war and fighting is not the answer, and later or soon, which we hope the sooner the better, the political solution will be the way out," he said. "We continue to say that peace is better. ” Qasimyar acknowledged cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan has improved in recent months to promote peace in his country. “I am sure if Pakistan is using its influence and closeness with the Taliban that would be effective and that would bear, I am sure, fruit as far as the starting peace talks are concerned," he said. "We see signs of better understanding of the situation.” The United Nations and independent observers have warned that 2015 is likely to be the bloodiest year in Afghanistan with Afghan forces bracing to fight without direct foreign air and ground support.   The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Nicolas Haysom, earlier this week in Kabul urged the parties in the Afghan conflict to ensure protection of civilians. “We have stressed that reckless killing of innocent human beings is probably a war crime, or possible a war crime and possibly a crime against humanity," he said. "And we are certainly demanding that there will be accountability even sometime in the future for those who recklessly cause the deaths of innocent civilians.” UNAMA declared the previous year the bloodiest in the Afghan conflict since it began documenting civilian casualties in 2009. It said there were more than 10,000 deaths and injuries among Afghan civilians in 2014, more than 70 percent caused by Taliban attacks. Afghan security forces also lost around 5,000 personnel in the previous fighting season. UNAMA said the conflict has already killed nearly 700 civilians in the first three months of 2015 with an eight percent rise in casualties from ground engagements.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 02:39:31 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/taliban-announce-spring-offensive/2729775.html\n'),

Opposition lawmakers condemn the plan as an attempt at fake democracy and vow to veto the blueprint when it comes to a vote later this year. After the plan was unveiled Wednesday, many pro-democracy lawmakers marched out of the Legislative Building in a sign of disgust. Protesters also gathered outside the chamber. Some carried pro-government signs. Others held yellow umbrellas - a sign of the pro-democracy movement.

At one point, the protesters blocked several key roads and numbered in the tens of thousands, posing a significant political challenge to Beijing. Beijing and Hong Kong officials refused to give in to the protesters'' demands, instead declaring the gatherings illegal and forcibly breaking them up.

(401, 'Beirut Solar Project Aims to Slow Power Cuts', '\nA river-spanning solar farm in the heart of Beirut is stoking hopes that renewable energy can play a key role in solving Lebanon’s power problem. Built on time and under budget at just more than $3 million, the Beirut River Solar Snake Project is claimed by its creators to be the only one of its kind. The government-funded project is set to be completed in a matter of weeks as part of a drive to make 12 percent of the country’s energy renewable by 2020. Pierre El Khoury, director of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation, explained that the 300-meter-long structure is both a practical response to a problem and an effort to spur the solar industry. “Solar farms are very important but solar farms use a huge amount of land, and land in Beirut is extremely expensive,” he said, adding that “the idea is to give a strong signal that Lebanon is really committed to producing electricity from renewable energy sources.” But although the Solar Snake will produce roughly enough electricity for 1,000 homes, millions more households will still be victims of a failing energy grid. Falling short Power outages are experienced by many across the Middle East, and Lebanon''s residents are no exception. A legacy of underinvestment, inefficiency and corruption that date to the country’s civil war make power cuts an endemic part of daily life, with many parts of the country getting just a few hours of grid electricity a day. The country does not have enough power stations, and efforts to build new ones are making slow progress. Reports estimate 1,600 megawatts of power is produced, thought to be roughly 900 megawatts short of what is needed. Though there are plans to increase its output to as much as 10 megawatts, the Solar Snake is set to contribute just 1 megawatt in its current form. But despite its small scale relative to the national problem, Khoury said, the impact of the Solar Snake goes beyond its immediate ability to generate electricity. He called the project a “landmark” in the effort to increase interest in solar power, and there are hopes that solar farms will be able to contribute more than 200 megawatts of output within five years. “Lebanon has witnessed a huge increase and boost in the renewable-energy business, thanks to the encouragement and strong signals that the Beirut Solar Snake has given to the private sector,” he added. Going private Among those to have spotted a growth in demand for solar energy is Leon Kradgian, who set up a solar heating business in 2009. He said that although it has been present in Lebanon for decades, the solar industry really saw increased use after the 2006 war with Israel, when Lebanon’s power stations were bombed. Since then, he said, the industry has seen a growth in interest among the public and business, partly spurred on by interest-free loans for renewable-energy projects from the country’s central bank. “When I started, there were about 20 companies [in the solar energy business], but now there are 50 or 60," Kradigian said. "Before, there was not education around the issue, but now you see electives to study it in universities.” Although the government has helped stimulate the market, it has not gone as far as many would like in helping the private sector address Lebanon''s electricity woes. Only the state-run EDL can lawfully generate electricity on a large scale for the public, with the company subsidized by the government to the tune of $2 billion a year. Power from generators There is a growing market in off-grid electricity, with many people relying on diesel-powered generators. But those who use them must pay both for state and private power, leading to greatly inflated bills, plus high levels of pollution from the generators.   Ayline Safarian works in the suburb of Bourj Hammoud, near the Solar Snake, and is set to benefit directly from the power it produces.  As the owner of a nail salon, she is one who has to pay twice just to keep the lights on. “If [power from the grid] cuts a lot, you have to pay more," she told VOA. "Every time it cuts more, your bill goes up.” Safarian welcomed news of the Solar Snake and its promise of more regular electricity from the grid. “Of course, that will have an influence on everything: on you and on those around you, on your work. You will have a little more money for yourself," she said. "My family dwells here, so they will as well benefit from this."   People will be able to "at least relax a little,” she added. Hopes are that soon, other communities will benefit from state-backed solar power boosting the grid supply. The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation is looking at the possibility of a new solar farm in south Lebanon, as well as examining less densely populated parts of the country like the Beqaa Valley. Fundamental reforms However, for the renewables market to truly flourish and benefit the Lebanese people, some argue that the private sector must be allowed to generate electricity to feed into the grid. Raymond Ghajar, a professor at the Lebanese American University and an advisor to the government, told VOA that the state “doesn’t allow the private sector enough safety or security” to emulate large-scale renewable projects like the Solar Snake. But for Ghajar, opening up the renewables market is part of the far bigger picture of moving away from EDL in generating electricity and toward the private sector. “All new projects should be owned and operated by the private sector, but the private sector will not come to an entity that is broken,” said Ghajar, who claimed that efforts to begin reforming the sector that began in 2010 had been stalled in parliament.   “We need a legal and administrative framework for the private sector to be comfortable, and this has not happened yet," he said. "However, I can assure you the private sector is more than interested and willing to invest.” Even Solar Snake evangelist Khoury acknowledged that “the real solution is in the update and in fixing the problems of the traditional power sources in Lebanon.” But he warned against underestimating the role solar power and renewables could play in Lebanon. "This is a first step in a long journey to achieve our objectives in renewable energy," Khoury said. "Renewables are a clean source of energy, and are becoming a cheap source of energy, and we are committed to pushing these technologies into public use.”\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 23:10:09 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/beirut-solar-project-aims-slow-power-cuts/2706548.html\n'),

(403, '\nFacelift or Folly, Belgrade Braces for Dubai-style Makeover\n', '\nThe vista of rusting boats and drab wasteland that greets visitors passing over the river Sava into Belgrade is set to be transformed into a futuristic forest of skyscrapers under ambitious redevelopment plans that have left Serbs deeply split. Construction for the Belgrade Waterfront project is due to kick off this summer, bankrolled by Gulf Arabs, and will forever change the appearance, and critics say also the character, of Serbia''s capital city, home to around 1.3 million people. The project crowns an unlikely but fruitful alliance between Serbia, an aspiring European Union member, and the United Arab Emirates that spans defence, agriculture and cheap financing. A UAE property developer plans to spend at least three billion euros ($3.26 billion) building 5,700 apartments, 2,200 hotel rooms, offices for 12,700 people, a curvaceous 200-meter tower and a sprawling shopping mall on the 1.8 million square meters of prime riverside land. The project marks the first foray into central and eastern Europe by Abu Dhabi-based Eagle Hills and board member Mohamed Alabbar, the UAE real estate tycoon behind the world''s tallest building, Dubai''s Burj Khalifa. Supporters say the development will create thousands of jobs, address a severe shortage of office and retail space in downtown Belgrade and put the city firmly on the investment map of eastern Europe. However, detractors say it is folly - a Xanadu conjured up without public tender or consultation, soul-less, elitist and jarring with the look of the existing, centuries-old city. A contract has yet to be signed even as land is cleared apace, fueling complaints about transparency. "It''s still unreal to me," said Dejan Ubovic, founder of KC Grad, a cultural centre in the graffiti-riddled Savamala district that has become a mecca for tourists and artists and stands on the perimeter of the proposed Waterfront site. "Nobody normal would have anything against some kind of improvement," he said. But this ''megalomania'' "has very little to do with ordinary Belgraders." Fearing for Savamala and the city itself, activists face a tough fight to block a project likely to define - for better or worse - the rule of Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic. Vucic''s nationalist-tinged but pro-Western policies have won him a hold on power not seen since late strongman Slobodan Milosevic, whose war in Kosovo brought NATO bombs down on Belgrade in 1999. "We''ve never seen [such a project] in the whole of Central and Eastern Europe," said Andrew Peirson of property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle. "Serbia''s the first to get them [Gulf Arab investors] and I think people are wondering why." ''This City Needs Everything'' Contacted by Reuters, Eagle Hills cited Belgrade''s potential as a "regional hub" as a reason for its planned investment, adding: "(The project represents) the future of the city and a world-class benchmark for dynamic, mixed-use living." That growth potential is tied up with Serbia''s EU ambitions. The project gives the UAE a toehold in a country likely to join the EU, the world''s biggest single market, in the next decade while costs remain relatively low. It can also avoid the tough public procurement rules, transparency and regulation demanded of EU members but more easily circumvented in Serbia. The first collaboration between Serbia and the UAE was a $40 million equity investment by Abu Dhabi''s Etihad airline in Serbia''s national airline. Other deals quickly followed. Real estate experts say the project would address the city''s chronic lack of good quality office and retail space, a shortage hindering Serbia''s efforts to lure foreign investors. Belgrade Mayor Sinisa Mali, a Vucic ally, says the new work for local firms would also help drive the anemic economy. "Do they [the critics] want hundreds of huts, shacks, people living in abandoned railway wagons? ... Do they not want an investor to come and invest several billion euros, to put to work the local construction industry and employ 20,000 people?" he said in an interview with Reuters. Peirson said Belgrade had plenty of work to do before it could expect investors to start queuing up. "This city needs everything ... You can get the government to fly out to Palo Alto and meet with Google and Facebook and tell them they need to move people to Serbia, but there are no office buildings," he said. But opponents question the overall viability of such a project in a country where a fifth of the workforce is unemployed and the average monthly net wage is 350 euros. The economy is facing a second straight year of recession as Vucic''s government tries to overhaul a bloated and costly public sector. "There''s no question that it needs to develop on the riverfront. The key is, when you see those plans, how long will it take to build that up?" said Peirson. "Because they''re going to have to follow the demand of the market, and not try and build it and then expect the demand to come." Mali said construction would take up to 20 years, depending on market conditions. Serbia will pay for infrastructure upgrades outside the limits of the site, costs put by Mali atjust under 300 million euros but at much more by the critics.

(404, '\nIndianapolis in Crisis Mode After Tourism Hit by Religious Bill\n', '\nThe rainbow flag, a symbol of gay rights, flies prominently on the Visit Indy website and Indiana''s Republican Governor Mike Pence personally phoned the head of a Seattle company that gathers 56,000 gaming nerds in the heartland each year. These are just some of the signs that Indianapolis, a corn belt city of 850,000 with a $4.4 billion tourism industry, has gone into full-on damage control to make sure its growing convention business is not harmed by a national uproar over a religious bill that Pence signed into law last week. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act - which to some meant religious freedom and to others a license to discriminate - was modified on Thursday by Indiana lawmakers to clarify that businesses cannot deny service to gays and lesbians. Pence signed the clarified law on Thursday, soon after his Arkansas counterpart, Governor Asa Hutchinson, signed a modified version of a similar bill in his state. With tens of thousands of basketball fans set to attend the NCAA Final Four men''s college tournament in Indianapolis this weekend - and Indy''s car-racing industry also expressing concerns over the law - tourism leaders were eager for a quick fix. “We have been working around the clock in crisis mode because the perception of Indy being unwelcoming has been everywhere,” said Chris Gahl, vice president of communications at Visit Indy, the marketing arm for Indianapolis, the state''s capital and largest city. Gahl said the group is “working feverishly” on the phone with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union and with Christian church Disciples of Christ to make sure they do not carry through with plans to cancel meetings in the city, which has built new hotels and expanded its convention center as tourism booms. But the biggest convention of all is Gen Con, a meeting of a Seattle-based gamer group that says it has a $50 million annual impact on Indianapolis. During Gen Con''s annual meeting, attendees gather at tables and computer screens for round-the-clock role-playing games such as Pathfinder or Dungeons and Dragons, trading card games, video and computer games, miniatures and board games. “We''ve been on the phone with them every day, reassuring them we are doing everything we can as a city to oppose the bill and ensure their executives and attendees they will be welcome,” said Gahl. “A significant portion of Gen Con attendees identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, and we are reading that some members of our community feel unsafe traveling to Indiana,” Gen Con Chief Executive Adrian Swartout wrote in an open letter to attendees, after Governor Pence phoned her on Monday. Gen Con had said it was halting plans for expanding its yearly convention until the RFRA was amended. Rainbow Flag The day before Pence signed the original RFRA last week, Visit Indy moved the rainbow flag up to the top of its website, said Gahl. The entity has been actively marketing to the gay community for five years, he said. Tourism in Indianapolis grown to $4.4 billion in the past eight years from $3.4 billion, and added 10,000 new jobs, for a total of 65,000 full-time jobs. Some 26 million visitors came to the city last year, up from 22 million in 2006, according to Visit Indy. Global corporations such as pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly and Wal-Mart Stores were among businesses that pressured Pence to modify or repeal the law.\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 19:22:13 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-indianapolis-indiana-crisis-mode-tourism-religion-bill/2706520.html\n'),

(406, 'US Reports Drop in Hiring for March', '\nU.S. hiring slowed in March to a net increase of 126,000 jobs, ending 12 consecutive months of job gains above 200,000 — the longest streak of above-average employment growth since 1994. Job gains in the previous two months were also revised lower by a combined 69,000, according to a report issued Friday by the U.S. Labor Department, but the setback is probably an aberration, said PNC Bank economist Gus Faucher. “We had a number of one-time drags that were factors — in particular, the weather — so I do think we will see job growth bounce back up to 200,000 or above," he said. "That’s a good solid number, and I think we’ll see that throughout 2015.” Economists noted that for months, hiring has been stronger than other gauges of the economy, suggesting that a pullback in job gains was inevitable. Job growth has been "increasingly out of tune with other economic indicators," James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, wrote in a research note. "The reckoning in March closes at least some of this gap.'''' Besides the weather, plunging oil prices contributed to a decline of 11,000 jobs in the mining and logging sector, which includes the oil industry, and a stronger dollar resulted in 1,000 fewer manufacturing jobs. Construction employment also fell by 1,000, the first drop in 15 months. But some categories showed gains. Health care added 22,000 workers. Professional and business services — a sector that includes lawyers, engineers, accountants and office temps — gained 40,000. Financial services expanded by 8,000, and retailers maintained their 12-month pace by adding 25,900. The Labor Department said the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.5 percent. The number of unemployed Americans was little changed at 8.6 million. A recent survey by the National Association for Business Economics suggests the U.S. job market is starting to tighten up. NABE spokesman Ken Simonson said that should eventually lead to higher wages. “Many business people report they’re having trouble finding workers, and you would expect that to show up in their paying higher wages — either to bring workers in or pay more overtime," he said. The latest jobs data suggested that’s already happening. Average hourly earnings rose 7 cents last month, to $24.86 an hour. It wasn''t a lot, but Faucher said that represented a 2.1 percent wage increase from last year. “That’s much better than inflation, given the huge plunge we’ve seen in energy prices," he said. "So consumers are seeing stronger incomes, and that will be a positive for consumer spending growth throughout 2015.” Investors did not seem too worried about the latest employment data.  Economists said that’s probably because the weaker-than-expected job growth might cause the Federal Reserve to delay an anticipated rate hike until later in the year.

(408, 'Ethiopia Steams Ahead With Massive Dam Project', '\nWith a newly-signed deal on sharing Nile River waters with Egypt, Ethiopia is moving ahead with the continuing construction of Africa''s largest hydro-power dam and the filling of a reservoir. The Nile River is a source of life for several African countries and, for years, a source of tension between Ethiopia and Egypt. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, begun four years ago, threatened to raise those tensions, even sparking talk of war. But Egypt, which along with Sudan long claimed near-exclusive rights to Nile waters, last week compromised in the face of reality, signing a regional pact on Nile water use. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi spoke to Ethiopia’s parliament last week on the need to share the Nile''s waters equally. Egypt fears its water flow will decrease, especially with Ethiopia filling a reservoir with 74 billion cubic meters of water. This will take 5-6 years, said the dam''s project manager, Simegnew Bekele. “The dockwater is extended up to 246 kilometers from the dam centerline and it will cover about 1874 square kilometers,” he added. Not that Ethiopia ever let Egypt''s concerns affect dam construction, said  Ethiopia’s Water Minister Alemayehu Tegenu.   “The dam construction will never stop," he said. "We will continue negotiating on hiring of consultants and will continue negotiation on the process of studies, so [all these] processes will not affect the dam construction. The dam construction will continue.” The first power-generating trials will start after the rainy season. Eventually the dam should have a capacity of 6,000 megawatts. Although construction is less than half-done, Minister Alemayehu said the project will be complete in 2017. “The four years in [the] past — it was mobilization and camp construction and erection of plants; this has taken a long time. Now all activities are towards dam construction currently. So we’re 100 percent focused and capitalized on dam construction. So it is not difficult to finish the dam within two years time.” The $5 billion-dam is being built without any foreign capital. The Ethiopian government is providing 90 percent of the money; the rest is coming from fundraising events across the country, such as bond selling, and concerts.\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 10:55:54 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ethiopia-steams-ahead-massive-dam-project/2705587.html\n'),
(410, '\nBillions Up for Grabs if Nuclear Deal Opens Iran Economy\n', '\nIranian investment banker Ramin Rabii says he shouted in joy when he learned that Tehran and world powers had reached a deal which promises to lift economic sanctions on Iran. Then he called colleagues to discuss the business implications. Rabii, managing director of Turquoise Partners, a Tehran-based investment firm with about $200 million of assets under management, has been grappling for years with the results of the sanctions: unstable growth, high inflation, international banking restrictions and hard currency shortages. The agreement on curbing Iran''s nuclear program, reached on Thursday, will - if confirmed in a final deal by a June 30 deadline - begin to ease those crippling problems for Turquoise and thousands of other Iranian firms. “We''ve been preparing for this moment for 10 years,” Rabii said by telephone, adding that in the months leading up to the deal Turquoise was in touch with hundreds of potential foreign investors about opportunities for them if sanctions were lifted. He said the company now planned to develop its asset management and brokerage businesses, and would hold roadshows for investors in Europe and possibly Dubai. Frozen out of the international banking system, its foreign trade slashed by the sanctions, Iran looks likely to become the biggest country to rejoin the global economy since post-Communist eastern Europe in the early 1990s. The resulting boom could create tens of billions of dollars worth of business for both local and foreign companies and shift the economic balance in the Gulf, which has so far been heavily weighted towards the rich Gulf Arab oil exporting countries. “Precautionary talks have already started between Iran and some big Western investors” in areas such as oil and autos, said Iranian-born economist Mehrdad Emadi of London''s Betamatrix consultancy. “Now there will be accelerating momentum.” He predicted annual growth of Iran''s $420 billion economy would rise by as much as 2 percentage points to over 5 percent in the year after a final nuclear deal. It could accelerate further to 7 or 8 percent in the following 18 months - matching the growth of Asia''s “tiger economies” during their boom years. Iran''s trade with the European Union, which totalled 7.6 billion euros ($8.3 billion) last year, could balloon 400 percent by mid-2018, Emadi said. Banking sanctions The complex web of financial, shipping, energy and technology sanctions woven by the United States, the European Union and the United Nations is expected to take years to remove, even if a final nuclear agreement is reached and implemented smoothly. As a result Iran''s oil exports, cut by the sanctions to about 1.1 million barrels per day from 2.5 million bpd in 2012, may not start rebounding before 2016. But the single most damaging sanctions measure, the U.S. Treasury''s use of Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act to identify Iran as a money laundering area, could be lifted quickly by the Obama administration, analysts believe. This would have a big impact on trade and investment by letting foreign banks deal with Iran without fear of being targeted by U.S. officials. Iran could be re-admitted to the SWIFT global payments system, from which it was expelled in 2012, within three months of a final nuclear deal, Emadi said. Rabii said the boost to Iranian production from easier trade would quickly spur the economy, even if big foreign investment deals took longer to arrange. “Iranian industry is currently operating at about 60 to 70 percent capacity. Thirty percent is idle - that''s because of the sanctions. Getting this working again is the low-hanging fruit of lifting the sanctions.” The economic benefits would extend across the Gulf, particularly to Dubai, which is a traditional hub for business with Iran and has a large Iranian community. The sanctions slashed Dubai''s trade with Iran by more than a third; the emirate could now become a jumping-off point for foreign companies going back into Iran. Airlines and logistics firms around the region also stand to profit. Tarek Sultan, chief executive of Kuwait-listed logistics giant Agility, said Iran was potentially attractive because its isolation had encouraged it to develop indigenous expertise that could allow it to leapfrog other economies. “When the international situation is resolved and restrictions are lifted, we''ll be among the first ones in there,” Sultan told Reuters late last year. Other parts of the Gulf economy may at least temporarily be hurt by the rise of Iran. Gulf Arab stock markets are reforming themselves to attract foreign capital; Saudi Arabia plans to open its bourse to direct foreign investment within months. These markets will now have a major rival for funds in Tehran. Any increase in Iranian oil sales could come at the expense of Saudi Arabia, OPEC''s biggest producer, which has lifted its output near 10 million bpd. The kingdom already faces a record budget deficit this year because of low oil prices.\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 08:48:29 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/billions-up-for-grabs-is-nuclear-deal-opens-iran-economy/2705391.html\n'),
(411, 'Greece Ready to Make IMF Payment', '\nGreece will pay a loan tranche due on April 9 to the International Monetary Fund on time, its deputy finance minister said on Friday, seeking to quell fears of default after a flurry of contradictory statements on the issue in recent days. Greece is fast running out of cash and its eurozone and International Monetary Fund lenders have frozen bailout aid until the new leftist-led government reaches agreement on a package of reforms. That prompted the interior minister to suggest this week that Athens would prioritize wages and pensions over the roughly 450 million euro ($489 million) payment to the IMF, though the government denied that was its stance. Eurozone officials then said Greece told them it will run out of money on April 9, which the finance ministry denied saying. “We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time," Dimitris Mardas told Greece''s Skai TV. “We are ready to pay on April 9.” Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to last-ditch measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said state revenue in March had topped targets without providing figures, adding that progress had been made in talks with the country''s official international on its latest the reforms list.

(415, 'US Farm Exports to Cuba Set to Grow', '\nAgriculture experts say U.S. farm exports to Cuba could more than triple in the next five years - reaching $1 billion - and support thousands of new U.S. jobs. Farmers and government officials told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee recently, however, that both Washington and Havana must remove more legal, logistical, and financial obstacles to reach this goal. President Barack Obama recently eased restrictions on trade and travel to Cuba and allowed Cuban-Americans to send larger amounts of money to their families on the communist-ruled island. But Obama can’t end the decades-old trade embargo against Cuba without congressional approval. Major resistance There is strong opposition to ending the embargo or taking other steps to ease restrictions from some Cuban-American members of Congress who call such steps “appeasement” of dictators and a threat to U.S. security. They argue that expanded trade would support a hostile authoritarian government far more than it helps Cuban consumers. An expert on relations between Cuba and the United States, New York University''s Arturo Lopez-Levy, disagrees with these critics, but he said it may take several years to fully normalize relations between the former Cold War adversaries. Cuba could be a much larger business opportunity for U.S. farm products because the island imports about 80 percent of the food consumed by its 11 million people, according to Michael Scuse of the U.S. Agriculture Department. Scuse and other witnesses said Cuba buys food from distant lands like Vietnam, New Zealand, the European Union, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. That rice, wheat, corn, milk, and fruit is available from the United States with lower shipping costs, giving Cuban consumers a price break, and leaving more room for farmers to profit. Enabling smaller companies U.S. farmers have been selling food to Cuba for a few years, after an earlier partial easing of the trade embargo, but they complain they are losing business to other nations because current U.S. law blocks the kind of marketing and financing their rivals use to sell more goods. Minnesota cattle rancher Ralph Kaehler said large companies may have the resources to prosper without help from the U.S. Agriculture Department, but small companies like his do not. Farmer Doug Keesling, whose family has been raising wheat in Kansas for five generations, said the current U.S. “rules and laws” complicate financing and make it “too expensive” to compete for business in Cuba. These farmers and other experts also complain the Cuban government requires U.S. goods to go through its “Alimport” organization, needlessly complicating and slowing down such transactions. Some business, though, is already underway. Officials at the U.S. port of New Orleans say they ship 25,000 tons of frozen chicken from American producers to Cuba each year, and are “optimistic” the trade will grow in volume and variety. Making progress Matt Gresham said New Orleans was one of the island’s largest trading partners prior to the embargo, and could eventually regain that status. He said the Cuban people will likely need farm products, machinery and many other goods, but he expects it will take a while for the island’s economy to expand enough to create additional buying power. That growth may be helped by Obama''s policy changes that loosen restrictions on financial transactions with Cuba, and raise the limit on remittances. Harvard University''s Manuel Orozco writes these changes will allow more Cuban businesses to offer electronic transactions, boost competition for financial services, and increase disposable income for many Cubans. Taken together, these changes will boost purchasing power, savings and investment. That will help expand the island''s small private sector. New York’s Andrew Cuomo is not waiting for political, legal, or economic progress. He''s leading a trade delegation to Cuba this week. That makes him the first governor of a U.S. state to head such a mission since Obama eased restrictions. Cuomo said he would like to sell New York’s apples to Cuba, and New York businesses have just made deals for a cancer research project with Cuban colleagues, and for computer software sales on the island.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:09:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/us-farm-exports-to-cuba-set-to-grow/2730620.html\n'),
(416, '\nUS Senate Panel Approves ''Fast Track'' for Pacific Trade Pact\n', '\nA U.S. Senate panel approved legislation to facilitate the formation and approval of an ambitious Pacific region trade pact. “This is truly a historic bill,” said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Finance Committee chairman. “U.S. trade with foreign countries is a good thing. We need to be tearing down barriers to American exports, while at the same time creating enforceable rules for our trading partners.” By a vote of 20-6, the committee approved Trade Promotion Authority with bipartisan backing late Wednesday. TPA, also known as “fast track” authority, sets forth congressional goals and benchmarks when trade deals are negotiated, but, once completed, subjects them to up-or-down votes in both Republican-led chambers with no amendments allowed. US, 11 other nations TPA is viewed as critical for approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership involving the United States and 11 other nations that, combined, account for about 40-percent of the world’s gross domestic product. Initial negotiations began more than a decade ago and have been extended repeatedly as more nations came to the table. U.S. lawmakers have been weighing in. “Over the next decade and a half, the global middle class is going to balloon by more than 2 billion people, and they are going to be spending an awful lot of money,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Finance Committee’s top Democrat. “I want those billions of people to buy products designed and built by Oregonian and American workers, and get those workers high-wage, high-skilled jobs in a tough global economy.” Others noted that Hatch and Wyden introduced TPA late last week and accused them of rushing to approve the bill without giving lawmakers adequate time to examine its many provisions and potential consequences. “They want to fast-track this ‘fast-track’ legislation so they can pass more trade agreements that outsource jobs,” Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said. “Trade done right can create jobs, but our current deals amount to corporate handouts and worker sell-outs.” Opponents of TPA pointed to prior trade deals approved under “fast track,” like the North American Free Trade Agreement that went into effect more than 20 years ago with mixed economic results. While backing the expansion of trade as a general principle, President Barack Obama has said that previous deals did not always “live up to the hype.” Wyden said current TPA legislation addresses prior shortcomings. “The 1990s play book on trade has to go. Our trade policies in 2015 have got to work better for America’s middle class,” he said. “Our country is going to aim higher in trade agreements. Our trade enforcement will be much tougher, and the process of negotiating and voting on agreements will be more transparent, will be more open, more democratic.” Full Senate debate The bill now goes to the full Senate, where furious debate is expected. “The answer is not only ‘no,’ but ‘hell no,’” said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid when asked about TPA. Nationally, TPA pits powerful business interests eager to expand foreign markets for U.S. goods against labor groups worried about lost American jobs and what they see as lax labor, environmental and human rights standards in other Trans-Pacific Partnership nations. The pact is being negotiated among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. U.S. Senate approval would have to overcome a likely procedural maneuver by opponents attempting block a vote. The so-called filibuster would likely delay but not prevent passage.

Etsy is an online marketplace offering handmade, antique and vintage goods sold by individual sellers.

Its revenue has grown steadily, reaching more than $195 million last year. As of December, the Etsy app had been downloaded 22 million times. Kathleen Smith, whose company, Renaissance Capital, tracks IPOs and developments in the market, said Etsy "is a leading online operator of handmade and vintage goods, including jewelry, furniture, clothing. No other company has been able to create this kind of community. And it''s a very loyal community. Mostly women. And in the prospectus, they will tell you that about half of the buyers and sellers in 2011 were buyers and sellers in 2014." Initial success a surprise Still, Etsy''s initial stock market success surprised everyone. Its shares opened at $31 on April 16, the day the company made its Nasdaq debut, and climbed above $35 during the day, more than double the firm''s initial public offering (IPO) price of $16. Called the largest IPO ever for a venture-backed, New York-based start-up, Etsy sold more than 13 million shares, raising $267 million on the day it went public. Smith said, "The company has really increased its spending on marketing, figuring that it has such a loyal client base that it''s worth paying more to keep attracting  clients. The growth rate is pretty good, over 50 percent at the end of the year and its looks like they can get this 30 percent type of growth." After the initial stock market hype, Etsy''s stock prices went down, sparking predictions that it will be sold. Liana Baker, a correspondent who covers mergers and acquisitions for Reuters news service, said, "I think, with Etsy coming out and the valuation in the low billions, it could make it ripe for picking by a bigger company like eBay or Amazon." But as of Tuesday, the company''s stock had recorded a slight increase, ending at $25 per share. Market analysts said it is not yet clear what Etsy''s future will be.   "That is going to depend on how management treats its new investors and delivers the kinds of expectation that investors are expecting," Smith said.    Founded in 2005, Etsy has grown from a website selling just wooden objects to an online community of crafters offering unique goods that cannot be mass produced or re-sold. Its supporters view it as an antidote to global mass production and consumption, pushed by big corporations. Veering from that path could turn off the company''s loyal base.

The Roswell Park Cancer Center of Buffalo, New York, on Tuesday signed an agreement with Cuba''s Center for Molecular Immunology to develop a lung cancer vaccine with a clinical trial in the United States, Roswell Chief Executive Officer Candace Johnson said. In addition, New York City-based software company Infor Global Solutions has identified a Cuban partner and reached an agreement to resell software in Cuba, CEO Charles Phillips said. Both announcements were made at the airport just before Cuomo and a delegation of 18 business leaders and academics boarded their return flight to New York. Cuomo, a Democrat, is the first governor to visit Cuba since a December announcement by President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that they would restore diplomatic relations and work to normalize trade and travel ties after more than a half century of hostility and confrontation. Obama has used executive authority to relax some parts of the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba but would need the Republican-controlled Congress to lift it entirely and establish normal trade. Among those on the trip were executives from JetBlue Airways, Pfizer and MasterCard. Cuomo had said the mission was meant to help New York companies be "first out of the gate'''' to make business deals under warming U.S.-Cuban relations. Roswell was able to finalize the agreement for a clinical trial as a result of the trade mission, Johnson said. "This agreement establishes a collaboration between our two institutions to develop a cancer vaccine in lung cancer,'''' she said of the vaccine developed by scientists at the Cuban center. "We''re very excited to take this to the United States to treat patients.'''' Phillips did not disclose the name of his new Cuban partners but said a deal was reached over a dinner of rice and beans Monday night. "We were surprised and impressed with the level of technology and expertise they have in health care technology,'''' he said.

(428, '\nBusiness, Labor Advocates Spar Over ''Fast Track'' for Pacific Trade\n', '\nAmerica’s top business advocate and its biggest labor boss sparred over proposed “fast track” legislation to facilitate the formation and approval of a mammoth 12-nation Pacific trading bloc. “Congress must approve TPA [Trade Promotion Authority],” said U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue, testifying Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee. “Nearly 40 million American jobs depend on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would open the Asia-Pacific dynamic markets to American goods and services.” TPA, or “fast track,” subjects trade pacts to up-or-down congressional votes with no amendments allowed and has been used to approve major accords such as the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated the 1990s. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said the mechanism “cedes important and long-lasting decisions about our economy to a few negotiators in a small room in the middle of the night. This is undemocratic. It’s wrong. And it has led to disastrous policies for America’s workers and producers.” Last week, the Finance Committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and its top Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, unveiled a bipartisan proposal for TPA that, if approved, would significantly boost prospects for completing and launching the Trans-Pacific Partnership of 12 nations that, combined, account for about 40 percent of global gross domestic product. “Trade is an essential element of a healthy economy,” said Hatch. “We should be doing all we can to advance a trade agenda that works for America and advances our interests on the world stage.” Trumka said the current proposal is weak on workers’ rights, environmental standards and other key areas. He expressed a strong desire to work with Congress to improve it. Donohue spoke out against delays. “Tomorrow is too late. Today is the time to move on these issues,” he said. Congressional debate on Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership promises to be the most raucous and polarizing on any issue likely to be taken up by U.S. lawmakers this year.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:06:32 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/business-labor-advocates-spar-fast-track-pacific-trade/2729084.html\n'),
(429, 'Delhi Faces Push-back on India Land Law Changes', '\nThe Indian government’s proposal to ease laws for it to acquire land has encountered unexpectedly fierce opposition from the Congress Party and activists, who have slammed the actions as anti-farmer. Speaking in parliament Monday, Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of neglecting farmers and instead representing the interests of industry and influential people. "This is a government of big people, of suited and booted people," opposition leader Gandi said, according to Reuters news service. Earlier in the day, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had introduced an amended bill to streamline the sale of farmland for development. At the heart of the controversial legislation is the government’s proposal to exempt defense, industrial, rural electricity and affordable housing projects from getting the consent of 70 percent of farmers whose land has to be acquired. The tough consent clause was introduced during an overhaul of land laws in 2013, but Modi’s government said that particular provision stalled scores of projects. Although an executive order has been issued, the government will need to pass the land bill in parliament. But with opposition parties refusing to come on board, its lack of majority in the upper house remains a stumbling block. Government promotes industry Government authorities say that building roads and factories in rural areas will industrialize poorer regions of the country and open up new avenues of employment for impoverished farmers. "Today no farmer – no farmer – wants his son to be agriculture," said Venkaiah Naidu, parliamentary affairs minister. "The reason is agriculture, for a variety of reasons, is becoming unrenumerative." Supporters of the bill point out that the government is trying to cut red tape and speed up development. Opponents say it will benefit industry at the expense of poor people in India’s vast rural areas. Land is a politically charged issue in India because farmland has often been acquired for a pittance by past governments. As a result, farmers remain skeptical of legal provisions to give them up to four times the market value of the land. ‘Political football’ Political analysts say the country’s fractious opposition parties have united to paint Modi’s government as pro-business and anti-farmer. Independent political analyst Ajoy Bose says that the Congress Party in particular is using the land rights issue to regain momentum after its humiliating loss in national elections last year. "It has become a political football now," Bose said. "This is kind of providing the opposition a rallying point and a convenient stick to beat the Modi government with. This is a problem for the Modi government and it is occupying all his energies." Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury pointed out that the controversy has snowballed at a time when Indian farmers are facing distress after unseasonal rains last month damaged their crops. "It comes in the context of … growing agrarian hardship and a restlessness in the farming community," Chowdhury said. "And every party has farmers as its constituency, being 65 percent of the country. It’s a hot potato." The difficulties in passing the land law underscore Modi’s challenges in fulfilling his commitment to fast-track business projects and boost the economy. While investors have become bullish about India since Modi took office last May, they’re still watching carefully to see how his government delivers on its promise to get rid of bottlenecks for businesses.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 12:48:54 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/india-land-laws-opposition/2728866.html\n'),
(430, 'EU to Thailand: Clean Up Fishing Trade in 6 Months', '\nThe European Union on Tuesday gave Thailand a "yellow card" ultimatum to drastically alter its polices on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing or face a ban at the end of the year on exporting seafood to the EU. Citing "clear deficiencies," the European Commission reported that action was taken "after thorough analysis of the country''s legal framework, enforcement measures and administrative arrangement, which impact on Thailand''s ability to comply with its international obligations." If a "red card" ban is imposed on the Southeast Asian kingdom''s seafood exports, that could cost Thailand more than $500 million per year. The key EU concerns surround Thailand''s failure to properly certify the origin and legality of its fish exports. "Thailand is deeply disappointed at the EU’s decision," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement but added that the government takes the allegations of IUU fishing seriously and "is now firmly seizing the issue." Thailand''s agriculture ministry launched a campaign in Phuket this week to improve the fishing industry’s practices. The government, under the control of a military-led junta since a bloodless coup 11 months ago, reportedly is writing stricter fishing regulations which are expected to be signed into law in July. "The EU chose to ignore the very earnest efforts of the past six months by the Royal Thai Government in addressing all issues which once were deemed the causes of IUU fishing," said the MFA statement. IUU fishing is an estimated $10 billion black market, accounting for about 15 percent of global catches, according to the EU and non-governmental environmental organizations. Several NGO''s welcomed the latest action against Thailand. "Thailand must now take positive action and work with the European Commission to be delisted," said the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), Oceana, The Pew Charitable Trusts and WWF in a joint statement. "Thai authorities exert very little control over their fishing vessels, with many activities illegally damaging fish stocks and the marine environment, and this is linked to some of the most exploitative and inhuman working conditions documented anywhere," said EJF executive director Steve Trent. "These conditions include the use of slaves and extreme violence." Thailand faces a variety of reprimands, including a lowest Tier 3 ranking by the U.S. State Department for human trafficking and safety warnings issued for its commercial aviation sector by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency. The junta has vowed to rectify all those concerns swiftly; it blames the problems on the civilian government it ousted. The powerful domestic seafood industry, implicated in IUU fishing and human trafficking, is regarded as having significant political influence in Thailand.   Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who carried out the May 22, 2014, coup as army chief, has sweeping powers under Section 44 of the junta''s interim charter.   The European Commission on Tuesday acknowledged progress made by South Korea and the Philippines in "appropriate reforms of their legal systems and are now equipped to tackle illegal fishing." Thus, according to the EU, the "yellow-card" warnings against those two fishing nations are now withdrawn. The European Union currently bans fish products caught by vessels from Sri Lanka, Guinea and Cambodia.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 09:31:43 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/eu-to-thailand-clean-up-fishing-trade-in-six-months/2728564.html\n'),

Referring to Western sanctions imposed last year because of Russia''s actions in Ukraine, Medvedev told parliament: “Losses from the restrictions which were introduced are significant.” “According to estimates of some foreign experts, Russia has suffered losses of 25 billion euros ($26.7 billion) in total, which is 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, and in 2015 it could increase several times,” he said in an annual speech to parliament about the government''s record. Medvedev said Russia''s economy had contracted by around 2 percent in the first quarter, but that the economic situation could have been far worse and was stabilizing. On Crimea He linked the sanctions to Russia''s takeover of the Ukrainian province of Crimea a year ago, but said the “historic” step had been justified. “For many the return of Crimea was the restoration of historic justice, which in its significance is equivalent to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany or the return to China of Hong Kong and Macao,” he said. Although the economic situation was stabilizing, he added, “there should not be any illusions” about the difficulties, which had been made worse by the collapse in international oil prices and “by several domestic problems that we weren''t able to solve.” However, Russia had seen worse in the past and could cope, Medvedev said. “If external pressure intensifies, and oil prices remain at an extremely low level for a long time, we will have to develop in a new economic reality,” he said. “I am convinced that we will be able to live even in such a reality.

A senior U.S. State Department official also said on Monday that a deal is within “grabbing distance” as the world''s largest and third-largest economies race to conclude bilateral negotiations that cover trade in car parts and farm products. Japan and the United States have been locked in negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a U.S. proposal that would connect a dozen economies by cutting trade barriers and harmonizing standards covering two-fifths of the world economy and a third of global trade. “I recognize that some countries were worried about the lack of progress between Japan and the United States,” said Koji Tsuruoka, Japan''s chief TPP negotiator. “However, bilateral negotiations over the past few days are a sign to everyone that we are making progress. We are now in the final stage.” A deal between Japan and the United States is considered vital to a long-delayed TPP trade pact, as their economies would account for 80 percent of the group. Narrowed differences The United States and Japan have narrowed differences on trade in rice and cars, Japan''s Economy Minister Akira Amari said Tuesday after a marathon meeting on Monday with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. “We haven''t solved all of our problems, but we are headed in that direction,” Amari said. Amari met Froman for two days in Tokyo to discuss details of a possible deal, adding momentum to multilateral efforts toward TPP. The two countries will continue working-level talks to try to narrow their differences further, Amari said.

(436, 'Turkish Court Bans Twitter, YouTube', '\nA Turkish court  banned access to popular social media sites that posted images last week showing a prosecutor being held hostage by gunmen.  But, the restrictions are the latest crackdown on social media, just two months before a general election.]] A Turkish court  blocked access to popular social media sites Twitter, Facebook and the Internet site You Tube. The ban is in response to the failure of the sites to remove images posted of a Turkish prosecutor being held a gunpoint last week after being kidnapped by two members of a banned radical left-wing group. The prosecutor was later killed as police were attempting to rescue him. Twitter and Facebook saw the ban lifted after they complied with the court order and removed the images. You Tube currently remains banned. The Google website is now also reportedly facing the threat of closure over access to the images.   Turkish authorities claim the images of the prosecutor, which were widely broadcast on Turkish media and the Internet, support terrorism and have caused distress to his family. According to a Turkish media report, a court also has banned over 150 local Internet sites for showing the offending images. But the banning of Twitter and You Tube, which are hugely popular in Turkey, has caused anger and concern in the country.   Yaman Akdeniz, an expert on cyber freedom at Istanbul’s Bilgi University, says the timing of the ban, just before June''s general election, is worrying.   "To be honest, I am not surprised or shocked at all; this was expected - expected prior to the elections. And the only thing we weren’t sure was when and why it was going to happen, and now it happened. Despite two major constitutional court decisions last year involving Twitter and You Tube, they still blocked access to social media platforms," said Akdeniz. In 2014, a similar ban was imposed just before local elections for postings accusing the government of corruption, drawing national and international condemnation just before local elections. The constitutional court eventually overturned that ban, citing the constitutional right to access social media, which are used extensively by opponents of the government.   Concern about Internet freedom in Turkey has grown since the government passed legislation last month empowering ministers to remove websites within two hours without a court order. Human rights groups also have voiced alarm at what they say is a marked increase in prosecutions of people who have posted criticisms of the government and, in particular, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A 16-year-old school boy is currently on trial for insulting a public official after he used social media to criticize the president. If convicted, he could face a jail sentence.

Poroshenko told members of a parliamentary commission, which is drafting amendments to Ukraine''s constitution, that he would ensure a referendum on the country''s "state structure" is held if the commission deems such a vote necessary. Still, the president said public opinion polls show about 90 percent of Ukraine''s population supports a "unitary model" of governance. He repeated that he is opposed to "federalization" - which, he said, has nothing in common with "decentralization." Pro-Russian separatists held their own referendums last May in parts of eastern Ukraine''s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, after which they declared independent "people''s republics" in those areas. Kyiv did not recognize the results of those votes. Poroshenko also said Monday that Ukrainian should be the country''s only official language, and that three-quarters of the population support this. Russia''s Interfax news agency quoted a senior Donetsk People''s Republic official, Andrei Purgin, as calling Poroshenko''s statements on maintaining Ukraine as a unitary state and Ukrainian as the sole state language "absolutely unacceptable things" that contradict the cease-fire agreement reached between Kyiv and the separatists earlier this year.

Four Ukrainian soldiers died when their vehicle was hit by a shell fired by the Russian-backed rebels as it drove across a bridge in the government-held town of Schastye, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the big regional center of Donetsk, regional police said. In a separate incident less than an hour later, a landmine exploded under a military vehicle at Shyrokyne, east of the Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, killing two soldiers and injuring a third, a military spokesman said on the TV channel 112. The new casualties, which followed the deaths of three Ukrainian servicemen in a landmine explosion on Saturday, put further strain on a tenuous cease-fire struck two months ago. The conflict erupted a year ago this weekend when rebels opposed to a new pro-Western leadership in Kyiv and the ousting of a Moscow-backed president occupied state buildings in two big cities of Ukraine''s Russian-speaking east, Donetsk and Luhansk. More than 6,000 civilians, rebels and Ukrainian servicemen have been killed since then in a crisis in which Kyiv has accused its former Soviet master of arming and supporting the rebels and the West - backing Ukraine - has brought economic and financial sanctions against Russia. The crisis has now reached stalemate with a cease-fire, brokered by Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France in mid-February still technically in force though deaths are reported almost daily among Ukrainian soldiers, civilians and rebels.

Love has triumphed over hatred, life has conquered death, light has dispelled the darkness! Out of love for us, Jesus Christ stripped himself of his divine glory, emptied himself, took on the form of a slave and humbled himself even to death, death on a cross. For this reason God exalted him and made him Lord of the universe. Jesus is Lord! By his death and resurrection, Jesus shows everyone the way to life and happiness: this way is humility, which involves humiliation. This is the path which leads to glory. Only those who humble themselves can go towards the "things that are above", towards God (cf. Col 3:1-4). The proud look "down from above"; the humble look "up from below." On Easter morning, alerted by the women, Peter and John ran to the tomb. They found it open and empty. Then they drew near and "bent down" in order to enter it. To enter into the mystery, we need to ``bend down'''', to abase ourselves. Only those who abase themselves understand the glorification of Jesus and are able to follow him on his way. The world proposes that we put ourselves forward at all costs, that we compete, that we prevail. But Christians, by the grace of Christ, dead and risen, are the seeds of another humanity, in which we seek to live in service to one another, not to be arrogant, but rather respectful and ready to help. This is not weakness, but true strength! Those who bear within them God''s power, his love and his justice, do not need to employ violence; they speak and act with the power of truth, beauty and love. From the risen Lord we ask the grace not to succumb to the pride which fuels violence and war, but to have the humble courage of pardon and peace. We ask Jesus, the Victor over death, to lighten the sufferings of our many brothers and sisters who are persecuted for his name, and of all those who suffer injustice as a result of ongoing conflicts and violence. We ask for peace, above all, for Syria and Iraq, that the roar of arms may cease and that peaceful relations may be restored among the various groups which make up those beloved countries. May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees. We pray for peace for all the peoples of the Holy Land. May the culture of encounter grow between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace process be resumed, in order to end years of suffering and division. We implore peace for Libya, that the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence may cease, and that all concerned for the future of the country may work to favor reconciliation and to build a fraternal society respectful of the dignity of the person. For Yemen too we express our hope for the growth of a common desire for peace, for the good of the entire people. At the same time, in hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world. We ask the risen Lord for the gift of peace for Nigeria, South Sudan and for the various areas of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. May constant prayer rise up from all people of goodwill for those who lost their lives - I think in particular of the young people who were killed last Thursday at Garissa University College in Kenya - for all who have been kidnapped, and for those forced to abandon their homes and their dear ones. May the Lord''s resurrection bring light to beloved Ukraine, especially to those who have endured the violence of the conflict of recent months. May the country rediscover peace and hope thanks to the commitment of all interested parties. We ask for peace and freedom for the many men and women subject to old and new forms of enslavement on the part of criminal individuals and groups. Peace and liberty for the victims of drug dealers, who are often allied with the powers who ought to defend peace and harmony in the human family. And we ask peace for this world subjected to arms dealers.

(447, '\nPope Decries Persecution of Christians During Easter Mass\n', '\nChristians around the world are celebrating the central event of their faith - Easter - the holiday that marks what Christians believe is the resurrection of Jesus three days after his crucifixion. Pope Francis prayed for an end to the persecution of Christians in his Easter Sunday address, commemorating the students massacred by Islamist militants at Garissa University College in Kenya. Francis, after saying Mass for thousands of people in a rainy St. Peter''s Square, delivered a mostly sombre "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message. Attacks on Christians in Africa and the Middle East have been the grim backdrop of all Holy Week ceremonies leading up to Easter. "We ask Jesus, the victor over death, to lighten the sufferings of our many brothers and sisters who are persecuted for his name, and of all those who suffer injustice as a result of ongoing conflicts and violence - and there are many," he said. The pope spoke as churches in Kenya, where al-Shabab gunmen massacred nearly 150 people, singling out Christians for point-blank executions, turned to armed guards to protect their congregations on the most important day of the Christian liturgical year. "May constant prayer rise up from all people of goodwill for those who lost their lives - I think in particular of the young people who were killed last Thursday at Garissa University College in Kenya - for all who have been kidnapped, and for those forced to abandon their homes and their dear ones," Francis said. Rainy Easter Mass The 78-year-old Argentine pope, celebrating the third Easter of his pontificate, spoke from the central balcony of St. Peter''s Basilica after saying a Mass below for tens of thousands of people wearing plastic ponchos and holding umbrellas against the driving rain. Calling for peace in Libya, where last February, Islamic State militants beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians, the pope called for an end to "the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence." He prayed for peace in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamist militants have also targeted Christian churches. "We ask for peace and freedom for the many men and women subject to old and new forms of enslavement on the part of criminal individuals and groups," he said. "Peace and liberty for the victims of drug dealers, who are often allied with the powers who ought to defend peace and harmony in the human family. And we ask peace for this world subjected to arms dealers, who make their money from the blood of men and women" he said. Just about the only positive part in the pope''s address was a reference to the deal reached in Switzerland last week between Iran and the international community on a framework for a nuclear accord. "In hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world," he said. In the United States, President Barack Obama and his family attended Easter services at the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, which claimed its history goes back to when Thomas Jefferson was in the White House.  The church''s website said it was founded in 1803 and a slave was baptized that year as its first black member. Easter celebrations in Jerusalem Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, thousands of Christians gathered at the site many Christians believe Jesus was crucified and buried. Easter celebrations began in Jerusalem with a sunrise service at the Garden Tomb. Pilgrims sang hymns of the resurrection in the scenic garden, which resembles the place where Jesus was buried according to biblical accounts. Facing an empty tomb carved into a rock, they proclaimed that Jesus is risen. It was a more solemn service at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City. Priests and monks in festive robes chanted the Easter liturgy in front of the ancient stone tomb revered by Christians as the place where Jesus rose from the dead. Pilgrims came from all over the world. “I have had an amazing spiritual experience here in Jerusalem as the place that Christ chose to come,” said Rick Keller is from Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. “There is a sense of connection here that is much greater than maybe a lot of places in the world. I think there is a spirit about this city.” Shirley Relosa, who came from Manilla in the Philippines, said, “It is a good feeling being here. It is divine and magical. The atmosphere is good, very peaceful. Everybody is smiling, everybody is inviting.” Jerusalem is packed with both Christian and Jewish pilgrims as Easter coincides this year with the weeklong biblical holiday of Passover. Christians believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and was resurrected from the dead in order to grant eternal life and forgiveness of worldly sins to his followers.   In the United States, there are a number of Easter customs that Christians participate in, including attending sunrise church services, and dyeing and decorating eggs. Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter next week. Robert Berger contributed to this report from Jerusalem.

(448, '\nEU Agency Found ''Issues'' with German Aviation Regulator\n', '\nA European regulator found "issues'''' with Germany''s aviation authority in a regular review of air safety enforcement, the European Union''s executive body said Saturday. Its statement did not say when the review was carried out, but The Wall Street Journal said the European Commission told Berlin in November "to remedy the long-standing problems'''' — months before last week''s Germanwings crash that killed all 150 people aboard. The Journal said it was unclear whether the deficiencies identified at the aviation authority, the Luftfahrtbundesamt (LBA), were factors in the crash. But the newspaper cited two people familiar with the matter as saying European Union officials had found the LBA had a lack of staff, which could have limited its ability to carry out checks on planes and crew, such as medical checks. Vetting of airline crew is in the spotlight after the German budget airline flight crashed in the French Alps. French prosecutors say they believe co-pilot Andreas Lubitz crashed the plane deliberately. A spokeswoman for the LBA said the European Aviation Safety Agency''s audits of national aviation authorities such as the LBA take place several times a year. She said the LBA had answered a single-figure number of criticisms leveled at it during the audits, and those responses were now being assessed by EASA. Parent company Lufthansa has said Lubitz told officials at an airline training school that he had gone through a period of severe depression in the past, raising questions about whether medical checks of crew members by air-safety regulators and airlines are rigorous enough. The LBA told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag it had "no information at all'''' about Lubitz''s medical background until after the crash. An LBA spokeswoman gave no immediate comment on the report when contacted by Reuters. French air accident authority BEA has said its investigation into the Germanwings crash would study "systemic weaknesses'''' that might have led to the disaster, including psychological profiling.\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 21:46:30 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/european-union-agency-issues-german-aviation-regulator/2707268.html\n'),
(449, '\nPope Presides Over Easter Vigil Service Amid Martyr Concerns\n', '\nPope Francis presided over the solemn Easter Vigil service Saturday night amid mounting Vatican concern for modern-day Christian martyrs whose deaths have dominated this Easter season. Francis walked in the dark down an utterly silent St. Peter''s Basilica at the start of the vigil Mass, which precedes the joyous celebration on Easter Sunday commemorating Christ''s resurrection after his crucifixion. In his homily, Francis said the Easter mystery requires the faithful to seek an answer "to the questions which challenge our faith, our fidelity, and our very existence.'''' During the late-night service, 10 people from Italy, Portugal, Albania, Kenya and Cambodia were baptized. On Friday, during the Via Crucis procession at Rome''s Colosseum, Francis denounced the "complicit silence'''' of the international community before the massacres of Christians in many parts of the world by Islamic extremists. The latest was the Kenya university attack by al-Qaida-affiliated Somali militants that left 148 people dead, many of them Christians. Francis has voiced increasing alarm about the attacks, which have led Christians to abandon communities in the Mideast that have existed since Jesus'' time. He is likely to refer to those concerns during his "Urbi et Orbi'''' message on Easter Sunday.\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 20:47:56 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/pope-presides-easter-vigil-service/2707260.html\n'),
(450, '\nAt Germanwings Crash Site, Recovery Efforts Suspended\n', '\nRecovery efforts at the Germanwings crash site have come to a halt, at least for this weekend, French police said Saturday. Authorities said they had found both black boxes and human remains for DNA analysis. The German airliner crashed in the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people aboard. Families and loved ones of victims arrived at a memorial site near the disaster location to honor the dead and grieve over the Easter weekend. To protect their privacy, police kept media off the site. Authorities blocked media from all views of the site.  Investigators said that voice recordings from the first black box, recovered shortly after the crash, led investigators to conclude that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. Lubitz, 27, locked pilot Patrick Sondheimer, 34, out of the cockpit and then put the Airbus A320 into a steady, accelerated descent into a mountainside. Investigators say he ignored the pilot''s frantic demands to open the cockpit door, which could be heard on the plane''s cockpit voice recorder. In 2009, Lubitz had told the flight school for Lufthansa, the corporate parent for its budget carrier Germanwings, that he had a "serious depressive episode," but Lufthansa certified him as fit to fly. Lubitz had 600 hours of flying experience, while Sondheimer had more than 6,000 hours. According to earlier news reports, the Airbus A320 had been grounded for repairs just 24 hours before it departed Barcelona for Dusseldorf on what became its last flight.\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 15:13:56 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/recovery-efforts-suspended-at-germanwings-crash-site/2706908.html\n'),
(451, '\nUS Scholar Points to Russia’s Military Drills as ''Provocative''\n', '\nRussia’s relations with the West have sunk to the lowest level since the end of Cold War, since Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and Moscow''s involvement in continuous armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which it is providing support for separatist rebels who are fighting Kyiv government forces.   Last month, Russia held war games that exacerbated even further its ties with NATO, the European Union and the United States. The drills, with tens of thousands of troops, took place in regions spanning the country, from the Arctic to the Far East to the volatile southern Caucasus, triggered eerie feelings in Russia’s neighboring countries, the Baltic states, once part of the Soviet Union, Poland, formerly within its orbit, and in Scandinavian countries. NATOSource Director and Brent Scowcroft Center Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council Jorge Benitez said that Russian military activities along the Finnish border, the deployment of strategic weapons systems to Kaliningrad and Crimea, and positions across the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, and in the western and southern military districts, mimicked a full-scale attack against Europe.   In short, Russian military exercises have taken on a threatening posture, Benitez said in an interview with VOA Serbian Service. “These maneuvers are very dangerous. They are provocative; they are excessive both in the size and in their frequency. The West, the NATO members are creating maneuvers of a few hundred, and a few thousand troops for training exercises,” Benitez said. Russia doubled its troops at its most recent maneuvers from initially 40,000 to 80,000. Last September, its military drills in the Far East, dubbed “Vostok-2014,” included 100,000 troops and were the largest since the Soviet era. In addition, up to 1,500 tanks, 120 aircraft, 5,000 pieces of weaponry, military and special hardware, and up to 70 ships took part in the exercises. Russia is regularly exercising tens of thousands of troops that “do not seem to have defensive purposes,” said Benitez. For last month’s military drills, Benitez argued that the areas involved and the forces included seem to have been deliberately chosen to send a warning to NATO.   “He [Putin] is probing NATO, not just militarily but also politically. He is trying to make the message of ‘I’m closer to your allies. I have a much larger military in this area and I can play a much quicker role in deciding on how I can deal with these things,’” Benitez said. NATO exercises are planned days, weeks and months, sometimes years, in advance, he noted, while Russia is conducting military exercises “on 24-hour notice.” The deployment of ballistic missiles and bomber aircraft are provocative indicators of possible pre-emptive action against NATO and Eastern Europe, contends Benitez. “It has to be made clear to Russia that any aggression against the Baltic allies would lead to a major war with the West. It has to remind and make very clear and transparent to Moscow and to Mr. Putin himself that any military aggression against any allies, specifically the Baltics, will be met by all of the Alliance working to defend them,” said Benitez He warned that just as the U.S. does not seek a confrontation with Russia that would escalate into a nuclear exchange, Russia should also “keep in mind that it should not provoke a conflict with NATO that would lead to a nuclear conflagration.” Poland and the three Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — are increasing military spending and have asked NATO allies, particularly the United States, to step up their presence. NATO is already conducting air policing missions in its Baltic members bordering Russia. To counter Russian military drills in the Baltic and Black Sea regions, the alliance is strengthening defense capabilities on its eastern flank with a force of 5,000 troops and command centers in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania.   Norway, a NATO member, spent 1.4 percent of its GDP on the military under the premiership of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. As Moscow conducted massive drills in the Arctic area near Norway’s border in March 2015, the county held its own exercise, dubbed "Joint Viking" also in March.   Neither Finland nor Sweden are members of the alliance, but both have raised the possibility of joining NATO. Further, Sweden has deployed troops to the strategically located Gotland Island. It has expressed intent to boost its submarine fleet after its armed forces failed to find a suspected Russian mini-submarine in the Stockholm archipelago in October 2014.

(452, 'Muslims Chosen to Build Papal Chair in Bosnia', '\nThe Catholic Church in Bosnia-Herzegovina has chosen a Muslim family of wood carvers to build a chair that Pope Francis will use during a visit to the country in June. Traditionally, Bosnians make a new chair for every pope who comes to visit. But the honor has never been granted to Muslim craftsmen. The Hajderovac family from the town of Zavidovici in northeastern Bosnia is famous in the region for carving wooden objects for everyday use, as well as religious symbols for Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox Christians. The family tradition started 50 years ago with Sulejman Hajderovac whose son Salem took over after his death and passed the skills on to his son Edin. When Salem learned in February that the pope will visit Bosnia, he contacted the local Catholic church and offered to build a chair for the pontiff. The proposal was forwarded to the church leaders in Sarajevo. "They invited us for talk and we reached an agreement. After the formal procedure was over we started making this chair. I am extremely happy that we got the project, because making a chair for such an important person is a huge deal," he said. The cost of the chair will be covered by private donations by members of the Zavidovici parish and the Hajderovac family, explains Catholic priest Miro Beslic. "I had a discussion with my flock," he said. "It was difficult at the beginning, because people are struggling financially, but once they understood that it is about the pope, the Catholic leader of the world, but who is coming here also as a political leader of the world, then people said: ''let''s go, we will support this.''" The family has agreed not to reveal the cost of making the chair. "It will be an honor for me and my family to build a chair for the Holy Father Francis," said Edin Hajderovac. He says that the chair is being made of walnut. Pope Francis will sit on it during a mass on June 6 in Bosnia''s capital Sarajevo. About 100,000 people are expected to attend. The parish priest meanwhile hopes the chair will make history. "With this, the Zavidovici parish will enter the history of Bosnia, and in a way, the history of the Catholic Church, and in the end the history of the world," he said. The Hajderovac family has put off all other orders to finish the chair by the end of May when it has to be delivered to Sarajevo.\n', 'Sat, 04 Apr 2015 11:37:29 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/muslims-chosen-to-build-papal-chair-in-bosnia/2706788.html\n'),

(454, 'Migrants Trek Through Western Balkans to Reach EU', '\nMigrants from Africa and other places are finding different routes into the European Union in search of a  better life. The Associated Press followed one group to document their trek through the western Balkans to Hungary, a route migrants started using about four years ago. Since then, it has become the second most popular path into Western Europe, after the option of sailing from North Africa to Italy. A group of more than 40 men, women and children arrived in Greece earlier this year, after a long and arduous journey from their countries to Turkey. In Turkey, they paid $500 each for a passage across the sea. Their leader, a man from Ivory Coast, agreed to pilot their overloaded boat to a Greek island in exchange for free passage. He is now leading the group through Macedonia along railway tracks. Hungarian borders The group''s destination is Hungary, from where migrants can enter Germany, France or some other Western European country without a visa or a passport. Jean-Paul Apetey, 34, of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said, "Really, you have to have the courage because there are many obstacles. The journey has many aspects, because Europe is huge. You think you just go to France, but before arriving there you have to walk thousands of ways." People in this group are from Ivory Coast, Mali, Cameroon and Burkina Faso. The trek through the unknown is fraught with obstacles and danger. But they say the risk is worth it because at the end of the road, there is hope for a new life. Fidel Castro Chimana, 31, of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, said, "Most of us, we are from Africa and we have many problems in our continent - bad economics, bad politics, bad work, so you can get a diploma and you don''t find work." Frontex, the European Union agency charged with helping the bloc''s countries seal their leaky borders, said more than 43,000 illegal crossings were made via the western Balkans route in 2014, more than double the year before. In the first two months of this year, there have been 22,000 confirmed arrivals in Hungary by that route. Hilarion Charlemagne, 45, of Ivory Coast, said, "We know that when we cross the border it''s against the law. This we understand. When you enter clandestinely into a country, you feel you are a criminal; the feeling is indescribable." Deportation Travel by night does not guarantee safety. After a chase by flashlight, Macedonian police captured most of the group and deported them back to Greece.   Mirielle Djeukam, 34, of Cameroon, said, "The trip has been very hard, too hard. If I knew it was this difficult, I wouldn''t have done it. I just can''t walk like this." One woman from Cameroon was able to keep her baby boy, who was born in Greece. Another woman from Ivory Coast got separated from her baby daughter, born in Turkey, during the police chase in Macedonia. The child was taken by the handful of people from the group that made it to Serbia.\n', 'Thu, 23 Apr 2015 01:29:47 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/migrants-trek-through-western-balkans-to-reach-eu/2731227.html\n'),

(458, '\nCarter: Europe''s Security Challenges Should Mean More Defense Spending\n', '\nEurope should be spending more on its military given the security challenges facing the region, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday, adding that falling investment had eroded Europe''s ability to be a capable U.S. ally. "They''re not doing enough. They are spending a smaller share of their GDP than they have in the past, [than] we do now and [than] many, like Russia, are spending. It''s too low," Carter told a group of university students training as military officers. The Pentagon chief made the remarks after being asked by one student what the United States could do to encourage Europe to be more financially committed to its own defense. Low European military spending has long been a sore point for the United States. U.S. presidents and defense secretaries regularly urge the allies to stop the slide in spending. The NATO air campaign that led to the ouster of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 exposed a number of weaknesses among alliance militaries, such as a lack of reconnaissance aircraft and of specialists needed to identify bombing targets. At a summit last year in Wales, the 28 NATO partners renewed their commitment to the goal of each country spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. But only four countries - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States - were meeting the target in the 2013-14 time frame, according to a NATO report in January. Turkey, France and Poland were just shy of the goal over the same period. Carter said Russian aggression in Ukraine, the refugee problem in northern Africa and the mass killing at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris were wake-up calls about the need to boost security. "I think when the Cold War ended a lot of Europe figured that its security problems had ended. And now they''re beginning to wake up," he said. "You have Turkey, a NATO ally, right there on the front lines with Syria and Iraq and the fight against ISIL," Carter added, using an acronym for Islamic State militants. Carter acknowledged Europe had been slower to recover from the financial crisis than the United States, but he insisted Europe still had the means to reach the 2 percent commitment.

Oskar Groening is charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder, related to the 300,000 Jews killed at Auschwitz in May and June 1944 after some 425,000 Jews were transported to the camp from Hungary. The now 93-year-old former Nazi SS guard faces three to 15 years in prison if convicted.  The trial is scheduled to last through July. The German press had dubbed Groening, who served at the camp from 1942 to 1944, the "bookkeeper of Auschwitz" for what he says was his main task: collecting and counting money seized from death camp inmates. ‘I share moral guilt’ "For me there''s no question that I share moral guilt," Groening told the judges Tuesday at the opening of the trial in the German city of Lueneburg, near Hamburg.  About 70 Holocaust survivors and victims'' relatives attended.   Groening admitted he knew about the gassing of prisoners, most of them Jews.  He asked "for forgiveness," adding that the court would have to decide on his "culpability."   Given the advanced age of most Nazi war crimes suspects, Groening is likely to be among the last to face justice for the atrocities committed more than 70 years ago. Groening, who volunteered for the Nazi Waffen-SS in 1940, has talked openly about the time he served as the “bookkeeper” at Auschwitz.  According to prosecutors, he was tasked with counting the banknotes found in prisoners’ belongings and passing them to SS authorities in Berlin.  He has admitted having witnessed atrocities, but denies having committed any himself. One of about 30 left Groening is one of about 30 former Auschwitz personnel that the German office investigating Nazi war crimes has recommended for prosecution. About 70 Holocaust survivors or relatives of the victims have joined the case as co-plaintiffs and many are attending the trial. For more than 60 years German courts had prosecuted as Nazi war criminals only those accused of having personally committed atrocities.  But a landmark court ruling in Munich in 2011 made it possible to bring to justice even those who aided in the extermination of Jews.  In that case, John Demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in prison for complicity in the extermination of Jews at the Sobibor camp (also in Nazi-occupied Poland), where he had served as a prison guard. More than 1.3 million people were sent to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland between June 1940 and January 1945, as part of the "Final Solution," Adolf Hitler''s plan to exterminate Europe''s Jews.  About 1.1 million of them, mainly Jews, perished in the gas chambers or from harsh treatment, starvation and disease.  In all, the Nazis killed an estimated six million of pre-war Europe''s 11 million Jews.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 14:28:16 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/former-nazi-guard-groening-describes-auschwitz-camp/2730501.html\n'),

France’s Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve says police have arrested a 24-year-old French-Algerian IT student who is suspected of being an Islamist extremist. The man was taken into custody Sunday.  It is not immediately clear why the authorities made the announcement on Wednesday. Cazeneuve says police discovered an arsenal of weapons in his car, parked in a Paris neighborhood.  He said they also discovered documents showing the suspect allegedly planned on carrying out an attack on one or two churches in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Police were reportedly alerted when the man called an ambulance after he apparently shot himself in the leg.  He is also suspected in the killing of a woman, who was found shot dead in her car in Villejuif. News reports say police are questioning his family.  Cazeneuve said the man has been on the police radar for some time, because he planned to leave for Syria.

France has increased security operations since early January, when Islamic militants opened fire on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and began a three-day shooting spree that left 20 people dead. Thousands of police and soldiers are now guarding synagogues, media outlets and other sensitive sites around France. Shift in focus Analyst Frederic Encel says the foiled church plot has shifted the focus on Christians as targets. Encel told France Info radio that today’s radical Islamists have revived old views of churches as symbols of Western imperialism and meddling - regardless of their denomination.

The 66-hour strike began with freight trains on Tuesday afternoon and was expanded to passenger travel from 2 a.m. (0000 GMT) Wednesday, idling trains across the country, especially in Berlin, Frankfurt and Mannheim, German rail said. Leaders of the two sides blamed each other for the strike, which German industry leaders said could cost businesses up to 100 million euros per day. About a fifth of the freight in Germany, Europe''s biggest economy, is transported by rail The GDL union, which represents about one in 10 of railway operator Deutsche Bahn''s nearly 200,000 workers, wants a 5 percent pay rise and a reduction in the working week to 37 hours from 39. It is also fighting for the right to negotiate on behalf of other employees including train stewards. German rail operator Deutsche Bahn said that only about 244 of the usual 805 trains were running.

(469, 'Pope Accepts US Catholic Bishop''s Resignation', '\nThe Vatican said Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of a U.S. bishop convicted for failing to report a priest who collected lewd photographs of minor children. Bishop Robert Finn stepped down Tuesday as head of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri in the Midwestern U.S. Finn is the highest-ranking Catholic official in the United States to be convicted in connection with a suspected case of child abuse involving a member of the clergy. The Vatican did not give a specific reason for Finn''s resignation but said the pontiff accepted it under canon law. Prosecutors said the diocese did not notify police for six months after pornographic pictures of young girls were discovered on the computer of the Reverend Shawn Ratigan in 2011.  Bishop Finn was convicted in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse and sentenced to two years'' probation but retained his post. Activist groups who support victims of sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy urged Francis to dismiss Finn. Anne Barrett Doyle, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org, an online abuse resource group, said in a statement that Finn''s resignation a "a good step but just a beginning," and called on the pontiff to publicly state that he removed Finn for failing to protect children. "The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice, that it shows a new era in bishop accountability," Barrett Doyle said. "That would be unprecedented, and it would send a bracing message to bishops and religious superiors worldwide that a new era has begun." Francis is also under pressure to remove Bishop Juan Barros of Chile, who is accused of shielding the Reverend Fernando Karadima, a notorious pedophile priest. The Vatican convicted the now 84-year-old Karadima of child abuse in 2011, and ordered him to retire to a “life of prayer and penitence.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 03:10:01 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/pope-accepts-us-catholic-bishops-resignation/2729783.html\n'),

(472, 'IS Recruiting Stokes Fears for Parents in Georgia', '\nIslamic State recruiters are increasingly targeting ethnic Chechens living in northern Georgia, and parents of some recruits are accusing Georgian authorities of doing nothing to stop the outflow. The 50 to 100 Chechen Georgians believed to be fighting in Syria are among a much larger number fighting in Syria from around the region, particularly from Russia’s North Caucasus, where Chechnya itself is located. It’s a trend that could threaten the stability of the entire Caucasus: If radicalized, battle-hardened fighters eventually begin returning to a region long troubled by poverty and Islamic terrorism. “The investigating agencies know better than us what is going on here and who is trying to send our youth to the slaughter in Syria,” said Meka Khangovshili, who has helped found an advocacy group to stop the recruiting effort. Earlier this month, Muslim Kushtanashvili, a 16-year-old from Georgia’s Pankisi Gorge, left the country without notifying his parents, and later texted his parents from Turkey, on his way to Syria. Authorities later said border guards were negligent in allowing him to leave without parental permission.  “A majority of those who got to Syria know nothing about weapons: they don’t know how to shoot. And most of them have never even traveled outside of their own villages,” said another woman, Elizbar Magroshvili, a resident of the Pankisi town of Duisi. “They are being used as cannon fodder.” Most Chechens living in Georgia, known as Kists, are descendants of those who settled in Pankisi''s rugged terrain in the 18th century. The region saw floods of refugees from Chechnya during the two wars that Russia fought there in the 1990s and 2000s.   The gorge, which is home to about 11,000 people in all, is near the Russian border with Chechnya and Dagestan, which also is racked by terrorist violence. Chechen fighters Analysts have said Chechen fighters are playing an important role in the battlefield gains seen by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. One of the group’s top military leaders is Tarkhan Batirashvili, a 28-year-old Georgian who now goes by Omar al-Shishani. The U.S. Treasury Department last year put Batirashvili on its list of “Specially Designated Global Terrorists.” Georgian authorities have long taken a mainly hands-off approach to Pankisi communities. In the early 2000s, during the second Chechen war, Moscow routinely complained that Georgia wasn’t doing enough to seal the border and prevent militants from using Pankisi as a refuge from Russian forces. Pankisi residents have called for tightening the border and for more economic development in Pankisi, where many of the region’s villages live in poverty. The lack of jobs or other alternatives make it easier for recruiters to target young men, residents said.   Georgian authorities said they are working to identify the recruiters. “I promise that anyone who promotes and incites young people and children to travel to Syria and take part in the fighting will be punished,” Georgian Interior Minister Vakhtang Gomelauri told reporters Monday. Opposition parties, meanwhile, called for developing a "comprehensive approach" to the Pankisi’s problems. Essential education program Leaders from former President Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement have warned that if the government failed to stem radicalism in Pankisi, Russia would use it as “the basis for legitimizing any destructive actions Moscow seeks to carry out against Georgia.” Georgy Mchedlishvili, a professor at the University of Georgia in Tbilisi, said Pankisi’s poverty does not fully explain why young men are joining Islamic State, given that young people from wealthy Western European countries have also done the same. He said Pankisi youth who grew up during the 1990s, when the Georgian state was weak economically and politically, have been easily influenced by extremist ideology. "The inhabitants of the Pankisi Gorge should be intensively integrated into Georgian society through the media and education,” he said. “It should be made plain to them how unacceptable and hateful the ideology inherent in [Islamic State] is, how unacceptable from the point of view of Islam itself.”\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 16:28:36 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/georgia-islamic-state-recruits/2729205.html\n'),

When Shante Thomas was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, it came as a complete shock. "Am I going to die? Honestly, that''s the first thing you think," she recalled. With the right treatment, though, many women can expect to beat the disease; but, with more than 50 drugs to choose from, it''s hard for doctors to know which ones will work best for any individual.  Add to that the fact that cancer-fighting drugs are highly toxic and kill healthy cells along with the cancerous ones. Right now, choosing the right drug is a guessing game; but, that may not always be the case.  Alex Walsh is one of the researchers at Vanderbilt University using lasers to study tumor particles called "organoids."  "Organoids are small pieces of tumor that we grow in a petri dish, and they’re about 100 to 300 micrometers in diameter," said Walsh. The tumor cells are microscopic. When given a collagen gel, they grow just as they would inside a human body. The cells are naturally fluorescent. So when the researchers add a cancer fighting drug, they can tell how well the drug works by measuring the amount of fluorescence. If a drug works, there are fewer cancer cells and less fluorescence. "Our idea was to try to eliminate toxicities from ineffective treatments and then use drugs that are more effective in treating breast cancer," said Professor Melissa Skala, the lead researcher. Skala said the hope is that with a more effective drug at the start of treatment, doctors can ultimately improve the survival of breast cancer patients. “We know a lot of breast cancer patients initially respond to their therapy and then later, their tumor starts to grow and they succumb to their disease," said Skala. Skala added that the next step is to see if the researchers can accurately predict which drugs will work before a patient is treated. The hope is that this type of targeted therapy could be available to breast cancer patients in five to 10 years. Then, people like Shante Thomas won''t automatically think a diagnosis of breast cancer is a death sentence.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 22:04:26 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/targeted-treatment-may-improve-odds-for-breast-cancer-patients/2709371.html\n'),

Scientists in Britain are working to develop a serum that will counteract the venom from all sub-Saharan poisonous snake bites. The Puff adder is only one of many venomous snakes native to sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Robert Harrison, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says every year, puff adders and the other snakes kill about 32,000 people. “It''s not only that; other people who survive the bite - about 100,000 of them - are living with severe disabled limbs or legs, just really very disabling conditions,” he said. The current method of producing anti-venom - starting with the venom itself - is time-consuming and costly, and the serum must be refrigerated.  Victims have to be treated multiple times and there are possible side-effects.  With the price of about $140 per single dose, the full treatment may cost more than $500, which makes it unaffordable for most rural Africans.  In addition, because of the way they''re produced, current serums counteract poison from only one species, or a few related ones, so doctors must determine what snake bit the victim. The anti-venom developed by scientists at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine specifically for Nigeria, proved to be cheap, safe and effective. Harrison says his team is using it as a basis for developing universal anti-venom applicable to all venomous snakes in sub-Saharan Africa. “We''re going to do that by identifying the proteins that are unique to all the other species," he said. "And taking these unique proteins. i.e. different from the Source Scale Viper, the Puff Adder or the Spitting Cobra, and add that to the venoms of the original three.” For this purpose the lab is regularly extracting venom from 450 snakes belonging to 21 of the most deadly species of sub-Saharan African snakes. Scientists say the universal anti-venom will be more affordable than current serums and will be effective much longer.

A 9-month-old boy tested positive for Ebola after dying in Kailahun, the district on Guinea''s border that recorded Sierra Leone''s first Ebola case last May and was for months the epicenter of the crisis. Kailahun went from recording up to 80 infections per week in June to zero cases at the end of last year. Nearly 3,800 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, but numbers of weekly cases are falling as steps to control the disease take hold. However, Winnie Romeril, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said local and foreign experts had been dispatched to investigate the case after the positive test result. Kenema and Kono, two other eastern districts, have recorded a handful of cases in recent months, but Kailahun''s successes had been cited as examples for other areas to follow. Alex Bonapha, the Kailahun district council chairman, said it was not clear how the boy may have contracted Ebola. Both his parents are healthy. Bonapha said the boy might have gotten the disease during a blood transfusion, or there might have been a problem with the sample that was tested. Sources at the Nixon Hospital in Kailahun district confirmed that the boy had undergone a blood transfusion before dying. "I am aware of the weakness in the health system, which means that the blood transfused into the baby could well not have been the blood that had been donated by his uncle,'''' Bonapha said. A health ministry official expressed serious concern over the case, which came as the focus of local and international health officials is on the north and west of the country, the latest areas affected by Ebola. Liberia, once the hardest hit of all the countries in West Africa, has detected no Ebola cases since the last confirmed patient died at the end of March. However, Guinea has imposed a 45-day state of emergency to tackle a spike of cases in that country, where the outbreak was first confirmed last year.

But now researchers say they have found fish oil may hinder treatment for cancer patients by making their chemotherapy less effective. Researchers say it appears that some fish-oil supplements interfere with chemotherapy metabolism, in such a way that allows cancer cells to reassemble after treatment ends. For that reason, experts say patients probably should avoid taking any fish oil on the day before and the day after any chemotherapy session. They also advised against eating oily fish such as herring or mackerel during the same 48-hour period. A recent study in the Netherlands, published by the journal JAMA Oncology, looked at blood levels of a particular type of fatty acid suspected of interfering with cancer treatment — one of the so-called omega-3 oils found in fish. Blood tests performed on healthy volunteers who took fish-oil supplements showed elevated levels of the specific fatty acid persisted for at least eight hours and sometimes much longer, depending on the amount of fish oil that was consumed. Fish-oil supplements are commonly taken by many cancer patients in the U.S. and other countries as part of a lifestyle change in the interest of their health. And, of course, many more people regularly take fish oil as a dietary supplement for other reasons.

The foods include those most commonly purchased by consumers.  Salt is a contributor to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. Investigators with the CDC looked at the sodium or salt content in 10 packaged grocery items. “We looked at bread, cold cuts, pizza, poultry, soup, sandwiches, cheese, pasta-mixed dishes, meat-mixed dishes and savory snacks,” said Linda Scheib, an epidemiologist with the center’s Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention. Scheib’s team looked at the salt content of 3,800 food products that contribute the most sodium to the diet.   They found that up to 70 percent of cold cuts, soups and sandwiches have a salt content higher than the daily recommendation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ten percent of snack food, breads and cheese exceed the FDA’s recommended daily allowance. Many foods that seem healthy, according to Scheib, are actually full of salt. She said "bread is the No. 1 contributor of sodium to diet." "A lot of foods that people don’t think taste salty do actually have a lot of sodium in them," she added. "So, we recommend people just read those nutrition labels, make comparisons, try to choose lower sodium options, be sure to eat more fresh fruits, vegetables and meats and cook more at home because that way you have more control over the amount of sodium.” According to the agency’s guidelines, individual foods should contain no more than 480 milligrams of sodium and prepared meals, including pasta dishes and sandwiches, should not be in excess of 600 milligrams of salt. The daily allowance for healthy adults is 2,300 milligrams or a teaspoon of salt.

(482, '\nBanning Too-Thin Models: Right Move, Wrong Approach, Say Experts\n', '\nFrench lawmakers'' move to ban ultra-skinny models is the right mission, but the wrong approach, say advocates in the fight against eating disorders. France''s lower house of parliament Friday passed a measure that would forbid anyone with a body mass index (BMI)  below a certain level to work as a model. "In the bill, I suggest that from now on, a model must go through a medical visit before she is hired, which would evaluate the body mass index, which is calculated by dividing the weight over the height squared," said Olivier Veran, the Socialist parliament member behind the legislation. "I suggest that the medical certificate for work ability cannot be delivered to people who are undernourished and who, therefore, are putting their life and health in danger," he said. Fashion houses and modeling agencies could face a fine up to $85,000 and six months in prison if they defy the ban and continue to employ models deemed too thin. It is unclear what BMI would become the French standard. A similar measure regulating models in Israel mandates a BMI of 18.5 or higher. In 2006, Madrid Fashion Week organizers banned any model with a BMI below 18, after a 22-year-old model from Uruguay died of a heart attack attributed to anorexia. More than a number But Claire Mysko, Director of Programs for the U.S. National Eating Disorders Association, told VOA BMI is not an accurate measure of health. "Just because someone is at a very low BMI doesn''t mean that they have an eating disorder, and just because someone''s in the normal range or even in the high range of BMI doesn''t mean that they don''t have an eating disorder either," she said. Mysko said the intentions behind such legislation are "good," but what is really needed is a holistic screening process that includes an assessment of attitudes and behaviors toward food, weight and body image. She said the National Eating Disorders Association wants to see models screened for eating disorders and is also pushing for tests to be carried out in schools. "I think it''s really important that we take eating disorders seriously," she said. "I am happy to see worldwide that there is a shift in that direction. I think we just need to be very careful and look at the effectiveness of these solutions." It is a position echoed by Katrina Mason, Policy Director at the Washington, D.C.-based Eating Disorders Coalition, which advocates recognizing eating disorders as a public health priority. "We know that there are a lot of different factors, and just measuring BMI isn''t necessarily a good factor in determining whether someone is or is not having a disordered eating lifestyle," she said. "I think we would say that there are other factors that should potentially be taken into account." A health initiative the Council of Fashion Designers of America formed in 2007 to address concerns about underweight models says it also does not recommend using BMI to determine whether a model should be allowed to work. "Eating disorders are emotional disorders that have psychological, behavioral, social, and physical manifestations of which body weight is only one," reads a mission statement on the committee''s web page. Public health effects It is not just the health of the models that is at stake. The move to put limits on the fashion industry is part of a broader crackdown in France, where up to 40,000 people are estimated to be suffering from anorexia. Earlier this week, French lawmakers approved a measure targeting websites that promote excessive thinness. Another amendment would require publications to let readers and viewers know when photos have been retouched. Mason says models'' appearances and false advertising have "a profound effect on body image dissatisfaction" with research showing media exposure can be a contributing factor to disordered eating. Dr. Tania Heller, Medical Director of the Washington Center for Eating Disorders and Adolescent Obesity, said there has been much concern that the fashion industry has promoted "unhealthy and potentially dangerous behaviors." "Young women, and sometimes men, may try to emulate these dangerously-thin models and view them as an ideal--one which is for the most part unrealistic," she wrote in an email to VOA. The National Eating Disorders Association, or NEDA, says 90 to 95 percent of anorexia sufferers are girls and women. In the U.S., an estimated 30 million people -- 20 million of them women -- will struggle with an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Dr. Heller said the move to put legislation in place that may prevent the promotion of unhealthy ideals is a step in the right direction. But NEDA programs director Mysko said screening is only one part of addressing the epidemic. "We want to make sure that once we identify that there is a problem, that people actually have good places to go to get specialized treatment."\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 08:18:11 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/france-bans-super-skinny-models/2705362.html\n'),

They are not alone in facing the significant social, communication and behavioral challenges that the disability presents. While there are no statistics available on the extent of the problem in Kenya, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says autism spectrum disorder affects 1 in 68 children worldwide. John Manyara, 23, is one of the few autistic youths in Kenya who engage in gainful employment. He works at Karatasi Ya Hewa Safi, or KAHESA, which translates to "eco-friendly paper." Simia Ahmadi began KAHESA three years ago with her personal savings of $12,000. Her staff makes paper from banana bark and rice husks, which they then sell at exhibitions, schools and trade fairs. On average, KAHESA makes approximately $500 a month, which is used to pay the workers and buy materials. Ahmadi began KAHESA with the sole aim of generating income for young adults with mental challenges. Her hope is that the workers "will be integrated into a regular professional field so that they are now included in the workforce and not isolated. Because once they have the vocational training here, they should not stop at that. They must fly with their own wings afterwards.” Grace Manyara, John''s mother, runs a cybercafe in Nairobi. For 10 years, she struggled with the lack of awareness about how to manage autism. According to her, the stigma related to the disorder is the biggest challenge that has yet to be overcome. “It’s a hidden disability, so there’s nothing to show that he has a disability," Manyara said of her son. "So there’s a lot of stigma. There are others who think that the child is bewitched — “kurogwa,” in our language — which is not the case. It is a manageable disability if it’s handled well.” James Karanja, founder of the Autism Support Center Kenya, notes that the government has neglected the plight of those with autism and says it should do more to reduce the stigma attached to autism. “We really need increased funding to institutions that offer training for persons working with those on the autism spectrum," he said. "These are the teachers, specialized teachers, medical personnel. We need therapists and also much more awareness." Although the Kenyan government cares for the disabled through the National Disability Fund,  those with autism aren’t looked after as closely as others.

(487, 'Unsafe Food Kills Hundreds of Thousands', '\nIn advance of World Health Day (April 7), the World Health Organization is urging governments to enact robust food safety systems to protect people from contaminated foods that can kill them. People have to eat to live, but the World Health Organization warns what you eat can kill you. Thanks to globalization, a vast variety of foods in and out of season now are available to people around the world. Unfortunately, the WHO says food can become contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemicals anywhere along the complicated production and distribution food chain that has developed with globalization. The U.N. agency says these contaminants cause more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhea to cancers. For the first time, it is issuing estimates of the global burden of food borne diseases. Department of Food Safety and Zooneses Director Kazuaki Miyagishima tells VOA there are so many food hazards, WHO experts had to limit their research to different enteric diseases. “We picked up 22 bacteria, virus, and parasites and according to our estimates in 2010, the 22 different pathogens caused 582 million cases of food borne illnesses leading to 351,000 deaths all over the world,” said Miyagishima. Dr. Miyagishima notes says the organization hopes to publish information later in the year regarding food contamination from chemicals. Lack of food safety systems He says Africa is the region with the highest burden for enteric food borne diseases, followed by Southeast Asia. He says the situation is particularly bad in Africa because the continent does not have well developed food safety and health systems. He says the production and preparation of foods tend to be below hygienic safety standards. He says very young children globally are the major victims of unsafe food. “Forty percent of illness and deaths happen in the children of five years or under and in the global population, this child population of five years and under accounts for nine percent.

(488, '\nSimplified Antibiotic Treatment Strategy Could Save Thousands of Babies\n', '\nOne in five babies worldwide develops a severe bacterial infection, including pneumonia and sepsis, resulting in the death of an estimated 700,000 infants. New research shows that young infants can be safely and effectively treated in their community with a simplified antibiotic drug regimen. The World Health Organization recommends that infants who become severely ill with bacterial infections be treated with a series of antibiotic injections in the hospital.  But many parents refuse hospital care or cannot access it due to a lack of transportation, high cost and distance from home. Now, new, more accessible drug regimens - combining oral and injectable antibiotics - given in outpatient settings appear to be just as effective as hospital care.   Several studies published in the journal The Lancet Global Health demonstrate the effectiveness of simplified antibiotic regimens.  The trials, involving thousands of infants, were carried out in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria and India. In Bangladesh, researchers led by Abdullah Baqui from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland compared two simplified regimens of oral and injectable antibiotics to the recommended standard course of seven daily antibiotic injections in sick infants. The risk of failure in the simplified treatment strategy was 8 percent compared to 10 percent in the group receiving daily injections. Researchers in Africa also found a combination of oral and injectable antibiotics in diverse settings worked as well as hospital-based treatment. Baqui said a modified antibiotic schedule for treatment of severe infection in newborns, using fewer injections, offers an attractive alternative to hospitalization. “It will expand treatment options to settings where hospital care is not available.  But still we have to work to develop delivery strategies,” said Baqui. The addition of oral antibiotics in the treatment of severe infections in infants means better compliance because fewer shots have to be given. Scaling up for community based treatment of sick infants, according to Baqui, means training local health care workers and strengthening health care systems, not a simple task. Baqui said the WHO is considering modifying its recommendations to include a simplified treatment regimen for severe bacterial infections in young babies. “We think the WHO policy will be revised. It probably will take a few more months, but yes, we’re working with WHO,” said Bacqui. Bacqui added that the introduction of simplified antibiotic treatment strategies at the community level will mean more infants will receive potentially life-saving therapy.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 22:53:41 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/simplified-antibiotic-treatment-strategy-could-save-thousands-of-babies/2703660.html\n'),
(489, '\nSix Trials Find Ebola Vaccine Apparently Safe, Effective\n', '\nSix early-stage trials of an experimental Ebola vaccine have found that it appears to be safe and triggered robust production of Ebola-fighting antibodies, scientists reported Wednesday. Since trials cannot ethically expose volunteers to Ebola, the production of antibodies is a proxy for whether vaccines could prevent or even treat the disease. There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, which has killed over 10,000 people in West Africa since last spring, according to the World Health Organization. It is the worst Ebola epidemic in history, but it finally appears to be abating. The trials — two in the United States and four in Africa and Europe — all tested a vaccine called VSV-ZEBOV, which was developed at the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corp. and then to Merck and Co. Inc. It consists of a cattle virus called rVSV that has been engineered to carry Ebola genes, which produce proteins meant to trigger production of anti-Ebola antibodies. According to separate teams of scientists, that is what happened, two papers in the New England Journal of Medicine reported. In the U.S. trials, conducted independently but cooperatively at the National Institutes of Health and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research starting last October, 52 healthy adult volunteers received single injections of saline or either of two doses of vaccine. The most common side effects were mild, such as pain at the injection site and short-lived fever. All 40 participants who received vaccine produced anti-Ebola antibodies within 28 days, with most responding sooner. The higher dose triggered triple the antibody response of the lower dose. The "robust'''' response to a single dose "could be particularly useful in outbreak interventions,'''' said Walter Reed''s Col. Stephen Thomas, senior author of the U.S. paper. The higher dose is being tested in a larger trial in Liberia. Partly through that trial, both VSV-ZEBOV and an experimental vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline PLC called cAd3-EBOZ "appear to be safe,'''' NIH announced last week. The other studies were similarly encouraging. In coordinated trials in Germany, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya, 158 healthy volunteers received a placebo or any of five dose-levels of VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Although the Geneva study was temporarily halted last year after 11 of 51 participants developed arthritis, overall there were "no serious vaccine-related adverse events,'''' the researchers reported. All 150 people who received vaccine developed antibodies to Ebola, with higher responses to higher doses.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 19:10:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/trials-find-ebola-vaccine-apparently-safe-effective/2703564.html\n'),
(490, 'New Blood Test Detects Down Syndrome', '\nDown syndrome occurs in approximately one in 1,000 live births worldwide.  Children with Down syndrome have intellectual and some physical disabilities.  Many pregnant women get tested for the genetic disorder. The traditional prenatal test for Down syndrome has been around for decades but comes with risks to the fetus.  Now, researchers have developed a non-invasive blood test that’s very accurate in detecting the congenital disorder.   Babies with Down syndrome, also known as trisomy have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which causes what used to be called mental retardation.  They also have a number of characteristic physical features, including short stature, a broad face, slanted eyes and a short neck.   Traditional testing for fetal abnormalities, called amniocentesis, involves inserting a long, thin needle into the womb to extract amniotic fluid from the placenta, or the fetal sac, and testing it for certain protein markers. The test is most often performed on women ages 35 and older who are considered at highest risk for giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome.  The test can also identify other congenital diseases, including sickle cell anemia and Tay-Sachs disease. Amniocentesis, performed between 14 and 16 weeks of pregnancy, carries a small risk of miscarriage.  CVS, or chorionic villus sampling, takes a small bit of tissue from the placenta and tests it for Down syndrome and other congenital abnormalities.  It too carries a small risk of miscarriage. A small percentage of DNA circulating in the mother’s bloodstream is from the fetus, and a new test, developed at the University of California, San Francisco, takes advantage of that. Mary Norton, an expert in high-risk obstetrics and clinical genetics at the school, says the non-invasive blood test analyzes this genetic material. “With advances in genetics, one can sequence that DNA, and measure the amount that comes from each of the chromosomes," said Norton. "And by doing that, you can say, ‘Oh, look there’s extra here that comes from chromosome 21 that’s consistent with the fetus having Down syndrome.’” Called the cell-free DNA blood test, it can be performed earlier in a woman’s pregnancy than the other procedures, between 10 and 14 weeks. “There are some false positives and false negatives, so we do still consider it a screening test that needs to be confirmed by a CVS or amniocentesis if the results are abnormal.  But it’s far, far more accurate than the last generation screening tests that are currently being done most of the time now," said Norton. In a study of 16,000 pregnant women published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Norton and colleagues describe analyzing fetal DNA circulating in the women’s bloodstream.   Thirty-eight fetuses were identified with Down syndrome compared to 30 using standard methods of screening. The cell-free blood test also yielded a smaller number of false positives than conventional pregnancy screening; however, it does not identify all the abnormalities that the other procedures do, and Norton encouraged doctors to stress that limitation in counseling women who choose to take the test.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 17:44:16 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-blood-test-detects-down-syndrome/2703232.html\n'),

Researchers found this to be the case, even when the two groups spent the same number of hours asleep.   It doesn’t matter if they sleep the same number of hours. People who don’t go to bed until well after midnight develop more health problems than people who go to bed and wake up early. That’s the finding of a new study by researchers in Korea. It all has to do the with the body’s 24-hour clock, or circadian rhythm, according to Orfeu Buxton, a neuroscientist in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. “It prepares the body for certain functions at an appropriate time of day," said Buxton. "It turns out that eating in the morning is something that our body’s physiology seems to be ready for. And we tend to shut down in the later evening. So if we are eating then, that is the food that is more likely to cause metabolic problems or potbelly.” The Korean researchers compared the health habits and metabolism of slightly more than 1,600 participants, ages 47-59. The group was divided according to their so-called chronotype or sleep-wake cycle. About one-third of the participants were identified as morning chronotypes and 95 were classified as evening chronotypes. The rest of the participants were somewhere in the middle between very early risers and those who stayed up late. The night owls had higher levels of body fat and fats in their blood and more muscle wasting than the larks, even though the evening chronotypes tended to be younger. Buxton said people who do shift work, whose work hours start later in the day, were more likely to have the characteristics that put them at increased risk for diabetes. “Some of the things that went with sleeping at a later time, in this sample in particular, were having a more sedentary lifestyle, not getting enough exercise, smoking and eating more of the day’s food later in the day," he said. "I mentioned before that breakfast is healthier than eating your food later in the day.

(494, 'Study: Sick Pets Rarely Infect Humans', '\nA new study documents the health dangers posed by the animals we keep as pets. Most people will not catch anything from their dogs or birds, but researchers have found that certain groups of people are at higher risk. Like people, our companion animals sometimes get sick, and fortunately, most animal diseases can not be transmitted to humans, but some infections can - like e. coli and salmonella. Certain people are more susceptible, starting with young children. “So, kids typically under the age of five,” said veterinarian Jason W. Stull. Also, “individuals who are elderly, typically over the age of 65. Women that are pregnant. And those that are immunocompromised in some way, so their immune system is not working the way that it is typically supposed to,” Stull said. Cancer patients may have lower immunity, but so may people experiencing malnutrition, or even stress, he continued. The Ohio State University vet has reviewed hundreds of published research articles on the subject. He said whether the animal is a dog, cat, bird, goat or chicken, there are precautions that can help prevent the spread of infection. Since viruses and bacteria are often present in feces, urine, and saliva, it is important to avoid contact with those, especially for people in a higher-risk group. “Trying to make sure the kids do not have contact with the feces from some of these animals or the terrarium or wherever else it may be kept. Individuals that do have contact with those areas, it is really important that they wash their hands with soap and water when they are finished,” Stull said. Relatively few humans get sick from their pets, though Stull conceded it is hard to say how many. Many infections that might be transmitted by animals might also be picked up at school or work from an infected person. But he reminds us that pets have well-documented health benefits for their human companions, such as exercising when taking your dog for a walk or simply relaxing as you watch your fish swim in their aquarium.

Now scientists have demonstrated that is really the case, and they say it is all because of our genes. It is hoped the research might lead to new preventative treatments for diseases like malaria. “We decided to look at this in a study using twins, where we compared the attractiveness of identical twins and non-identical twins,” said Dr. James Logan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In collaboration with the University of Florida, Logan and his team performed a series of trials using 18 identical and 19 non-identical female twins. Mosquitoes were released down Y-shaped tubes, and chose which twin they wanted to bite by turning left or right. Identical twins had a very similar level of attractiveness to the mosquitoes, while non-identical twins differed.  “That suggests the trait for being attractive or unattractive to mosquitoes is controlled by our genes," Logan said. "We know that if you are unattractive to mosquitoes, you produce natural repellents. So it is likely that the genes that are controlling how attractive we are, are controlling the odors being produced by our body,” he said.   Researchers are conducting further work, which they hope could lead to new preventative treatments.   “Once we know which genes are involved, we might be able to assess a population for their level of risk of being bitten by a mosquito and therefore their risk of a disease like malaria or dengue [fever],"Logan said. A drug could then be developed that would regulate repellents by the body naturally, which would repel mosquitoes, he continued.   Mosquitoes transmit diseases like malaria, which kills around half a million people a year.   Thanks to better preventative measures and new drugs, the World Health Organization reported a 47 percent drop in malaria deaths in the past decade, the equivalent of about 3.9 million children''s deaths averted. “I would actually call it unprecedented progress, in the fight against malaria.  But 97 countries around the globe have continued transmission of this parasite, that means that around 3.2 billion people remain at risk of infection,” said Prof. Pedro L. Alonso, director of the WHO’s Global Malaria Program. There are many anecdotal theories on how to deter mosquitoes, as varied as eating garlic, drinking beer, or ingesting high levels of vitamin B.

The World Health Organization warns progress toward the U.N.''s goal of 90 percent global vaccination coverage is stalling. It says one in five children worldwide is missing out on routine life-saving immunization. Data for 2013 show nearly 22 million infants missed getting their required three doses of diphtheria and tetanus-pertussis vaccines. Many of these children are living in the world’s poorest countries. WHO Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele says the plateau in vaccination rates carries terrible consequences. He says about 1.5 million children are dying prematurely from preventable diseases each year. He says one way to remedy this is by integrating immunization with other health services. “We have data that show that up to 40 percent of children who are seen at health clinics for various reasons would go out without being checked for their vaccination status, without being vaccinated when they should have been vaccinated. So, correcting this, what we call missed opportunities for vaccination, is for us a key action to improve immunization. WHO says reasons for low vaccination coverage include lack of access to health services, insufficient number of health care workers, inadequate supply of vaccines, and insecurity. The U.N. agency says 35 countries have an immunization coverage rate below 80 percent. The majority of them are in just six countries — India, Pakistan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Afghanistan. Dr. Okwo-Bele tells VOA that officials in these countries know they have to do better and are making efforts to improve immunization. “I mentioned India, truly using the asset that they have that have driven the polio eradication program and now in support of routine immunization," he said. "So we may have already seen some improvements, but the data for 2014 has yet to come in. Pakistan, I said it, we were already there, fantastic in terms of planning today in what they are doing. In Nigeria, we have evidence that coverage has improved.” WHO estimates immunizations prevent between two and three million deaths annually and protect many more people from illness and disability. It notes there are new life-saving vaccines against diarrhea and pneumonia, and reports the development of vaccines to protect adolescents and adults against influenza, meningitis and cervical and liver cancers. Health officials urge nations to build upon these successes and not to become lulled into a sense of false security.

The project, led by British scientists with West African and Saudi Arabian collaboration, hopes to encourage laboratories around the world to use the live data - updated as new cases emerge - to find new ways to diagnose and treat the killer diseases, and ideally, ultimately, prevent them. "The collective expertise of the world''s infectious disease experts is more powerful than any single lab, and the best way of tapping into this ... is to make data freely available as soon as possible," said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity which is funding the work. The gene sequences, already available for MERS cases and soon to come in the case of Ebola, will be posted on the website virological.org for anyone to see, access and use. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral disease which first emerged in humans in 2012 and has been spreading in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries since then. It is caused by a coronavirus and has already killed more than 430 people. An unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 10,000 people in the past year and infected more than 25,000 mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Despite the many deaths caused by Ebola and MERS, researchers still know relatively little about the viruses - including what animals might be acting as "viral reservoirs" - and scientists are battling to develop safe and effective cures or vaccines against them. Genetic changes Paul Kellam, a professor at Britain''s Sanger Institute, said mapping the gene structure, or sequencing the genome, of a virus can tell scientists a lot about how it is spreading and changing, and help in the search for better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent infections. "With more genetic surveillance we can spot things that are potential areas of concern - such as [genetic] changes that might mean our diagnostics might not work so well any more, or changes that suggest a virus is becoming able to transmit more easily," he explained in a telephone interview. Yet while this kind of data is invaluable to researchers, it is rarely shared swiftly or freely enough among them. Saudi Arabia was widely criticized at the start of the MERS outbreak for being slow to cooperate with experts around the world wanting to conduct crucial research on the disease. Kellam said Saudi authorities are now committed to sharing viral data widely and immediately, keen to enlist the help of international scientists in controlling MERS. As part of the same gene sequencing project, Ian Goodfellow from the University of Cambridge is in Sierra Leone working with the government there to make similar data on the Ebola virus available on virological.org as soon as possible.

Despite laws that ban parents from having tests to determine the gender of unborn children, sex-selective abortions remain a common practice in parts of India. They''ve resulted in a decline in the number of girls compared to boys. "You have 2,000 girls who are killed in the womb every day. Some are born and have pillows on their faces choking them," Maneka Gandhi told NDTV news channel late on Monday. India''s 2011 census showed that while the overall female-to-male ratio has improved marginally since the last census a decade ago, fewer girls were born than boys and the number of girls younger than six plummeted for the fifth straight decade. A May 2011 study in British medical journal The Lancet found that up to 12 million Indian girls were aborted over the last three decades, resulting in a skewed child sex ratio of 918 girls to every 1,000 boys in 2011, versus 962 in 1981. India''s traditionally male-dominated culture views sons as assets — breadwinners who will provide for the family, carry on the family name, and perform the last rites for their parents, an important ritual in many faiths. Girls are often seen as a liability, with families having to dig deep for a substantial dowry to ensure a desirable match. In a culture that views premarital sex as bringing shame to the girl''s family, parents also worry about their safety. Gandhi said that the government''s “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” (Save the Daughter, Educate the Daughter) campaign, which aims to reverse the declining number of girls, had already shown results since its launch in January. The initiative, which is being run in 100 districts where the ratio of girls to boys is particularly low, aims to better enforce laws that criminalize pre-birth gender selection and improve girls'' access to education. “We didn''t expect results to show for at least a year or two years, if at all, as it''s one of those mindset-change things,” Gandhi said in her first television interview since taking office last May. She added that the campaign had led to an increase in unwanted girl infants ending up in orphanages but said this was a positive response as it meant they had moved "from being killed to being thrown out."

Nayyar is is co-editor of a special report on fake medicines in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The report collects 17 research papers highlighting the problem. In one, a decade-long analysis of drug samples found about 11 percent of the drugs in Africa and 3.5 percent in Asia were either counterfeit or substandard.   Counterfeits, which can sometimes be hard to tell from the genuine product, get a lot of headlines, but if there’s a problem with the drug, it’s more likely that it just won’t have the prescribed amount the active ingredient.   Patricia Tabernero of the University of Oxford studied the quality of anti-malaria drugs in Laos. She and her colleagues found no fakes, a big improvement from a previous study a decade earlier. But they did find lots of the medicine was substandard.   “Patients are still exposed to poorly-manufactured drugs or ineffective drugs, such as chloroquine, because 25 percent of the samples, they either contained lower quantities of the drug or higher quantities,” she told reporters in a briefing. That’s a particular problem with malaria medicines, because giving the patient too little can often promote drug-resistant forms of the malaria parasite.   Many scientists say there is a need for better ways to test drug potency in the field. And Amir Attaran of the University of Ottawa says a better legal framework is essential, pointing out that’s how the world deals with problems like this that cross international boundaries.   “There’s been an international treaty against counterfeit money since 1929,” he said. “If we’re serious about solving this problem with medicine, we need to get to where we were in 1929 with money.”\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 17:28:36 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/fake-substandard-medicines-pose-global-challenge/2727462.html\n'),

Many dog owners fear their pets could infect them with the Ebola virus and have abandoned them, leading to an increase in the country''s stray dog population.   Rabies is endemic in Sierra Leone, which has one of the largest stray dog populations in Africa.  The situation has become worse during the Ebola crisis. Dr. Gudosh Jalloh is one of only a few veterinarians in the country.  His organization the Sierra Leone Animal Welfare Society and other local partners have launched a campaign to create more awareness on caring for dogs in the time of Ebola. Jalloh estimates there are about 500,000 stray dogs in Sierra Leone, double the number before Ebola.  He says part of the reason for the increase is when owners die from the disease, no one else wants the dog because they fear it will transmit the virus. “So people started to stigmatize their dog, abandon them, not looking after them, we had some communities where people were really being cruel to the animal, to the dogs,” he said. But according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, dogs can carry the virus but cannot transmit it.   Jalloh has been traveling around the country informing communities that dogs cannot transmit Ebola. He also says there is concern about rabies increasing with this overpopulation.  For years he has been trying to keep rabies down by giving free vaccinations and sterilizing dogs.  He relies mainly on international funding, but he says it is always an uphill battle financially. During this Ebola crisis, the rabies vaccine was not available in the country for several months because airlines canceled flights to Sierra Leone.  Only within the past few weeks has he received a rabies vaccine. “What we really need to do now is to do humane dog population control, which will include vaccination, sterilization and, when necessary, humane culling," Jalloh said. Mabinty Kamara works with the Freetown City Council -- a partner in the campaign -- and says another goal is to reduce animal abuse by making sure communities realize the importance of dogs.   “These animals are very useful to us, at night we have thieves coming around and dogs will bark at them, so they will be scared," Kamara said.  "So it is very important for us to take care of these animals.” Kamara says reaction from the communities has been good and most are complying with the campaign''s advice. Veterinarian Emmanuel Wilson, who works in the campaign with the Ministry of Agriculture, says education is key. “Some of them like to take pets when they are very young, as time goes on, so they lose interest and leave them out in street to roam about.  But if they have education, to take care of their animals, we will not see any dogs in the street,” he said. Jalloh says he will continue to do this kind of work, because of his strong passion for animals.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 16:45:52 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/sierra-leone-stray-dog-population-ebola-crisis-/2727392.html\n'),
(504, '\nNew Brain Mapping Techniques Could Ease Chronic Pain\n', '\nPeople who suffer from chronic pain are sometimes met with skepticism because medical tests can’t conclusively prove the existence of such discomfort, but now new methods for mapping pain in the brain not only validate sufferers of chronic pain but might someday also lead to better treatment.   Chronic pain, that lasts for months and years, afflicts one out of every five people. It can lead to lost jobs, depression, and rising despair when medical interventions fail or health experts hint that a pain sufferer is making it up. At a support group in Boulder, Colorado, chronic pain sufferers commiserate about the responses they''ve all heard. “Docs don’t seem to understand what’s going on," says Charles Horowitz, the leader of the group, who has chronic back pain. "First they say, well let’s try this, let’s try that.” One of the women in the group interjects “. . .  if you’re lucky.” Horowitz nods and says, “Sooner or later, they’re probably going to say, uh, I think you need to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist.”   But a session with Harvard researcher Clas Linnman may be more productive. Using Positron Emission tomography to map inflammation, he has been able to show that even without obvious tissue damage, people who report whiplash pain have more inflammation in their necks. For the pain of tennis elbow, the inflammation is near the elbow. “A lot of patients are met with skepticism that, ''Ah, it’s probably nothing and you’re just complaining,'' but we’re trying to get a good objective marker of the ongoing suffering these patients experience.”   Brain imaging from University of Colorado scientist Tor Wager shows differences between long term and sudden pain. Sudden pain, such as touching a hot plate, triggers centers in the brain that govern fast action - like pulling your hand away. Pointing to MRI images, he explains that the pain signaling goes to many places in the brain at once.   In contrast, chronic pain activates brain areas tied to emotion and memories, and what Wager calls, “caring.”   “So when we have people experience this hot stimulus and then imagine that it’s burning your hand, bubbling, blistering, [the pain] gets worse."   But when they focused on calming images instead, such as a warm blanket on a cool day, Wager says the “caring” centers lit up, and the pain eased.   "Your ability to work with pain, mentally, can have effects on how this system amplifies or diminishes pain.” This makes sense to Horowitz, which is why these days he spends more time with friends, as one form of “re-framing” pain. And he is a big fan of meditation. He is hopeful that in the years ahead, discoveries from researchers mapping the brain will help identify just what therapies work best for each sufferer, and lead more people out of the tangle of chronic pain.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 15:15:37 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-brain-mapping-techniques-could-ease-chronic-pain/2727148.html\n'),

(506, '\nNew Test Set to Be Game Changer in Eradicating Malaria\n', '\nThe World Health Organization estimates 3.4 billion people are at risk of malaria, with children under the age of five and pregnant women being the most vulnerable. As World Malaria Day approaches (April 25), mortality rates are falling and a new test - well into the last stage of trials - is having positive results in Kenya. Fatuma Chaunga, a mother of two, lives in the coastal region of Likoni in Mombasa. Two years ago, most of Chaunga’s income from selling french fries and deep-fried buns was spent on hospital bills to treat malaria. Mombasa is a malaria-prone region. More than 60 percent of the population is at risk of malaria in Kenya, where almost 36,000 children die from the disease each year. Bed nets A non-governmental organization called "Population Services Kenya" distributes insecticide-treated bed nets to pregnant mothers and mothers with children under one year old. Chaunga was one of the beneficiaries. “If I do not use the net, my children will get malaria, and I will have to go to hospital or use herbal medicine," said Chaunga. "That is before I knew of MRDT. Now that I know of it, I see the importance of using the net so as to save on costs of going for treatment and use the little money I have to sustain my family.” The MRDT that Chaunga mentions is the Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test. In 2010, the World Health Organization recommended every suspected malaria case be confirmed by parasitological testing. PS Kenya provides the test to more than 4,000 public health facilities. The MRDT gives results in 20 minutes and costs $1, which is affordable even in rural communities.   Dr. Dismas Osoro said it has helped reduce the abuse of antibiotics. “Because earlier people were just taking anti-malarials without a test. This time we have got the importance of it. We test and dispense anti-malarials, so the reckless use of anti-malarial drugs has been controlled,” said Osoro. The World Health Organization estimates there were 198 million cases of malaria in 2013, which led to 584,000 deaths world-wide -- most of them in Africa among children under the age of five. That makes mosquito-net distribution in malaria-endemic regions crucial. Behavioral changes But, according to PS Kenya regional programs coordinator James Makiri, the biggest challenge is changing mindsets. “People tend to sleep under the net during the rainy season. But during the dry season, when it is hot, they do not sleep under [the] net because it is too hot. So what we are trying to do is encourage people to sleep under [the] net every time of the year.” For 30 years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has collaborated with the Kenya Medical Research Institute to fight malaria.  This collaboration is developing a vaccine being tested on 16,000 children.   Professor Francis Kimani said the results have been promising - but it''s only part of a multi-pronged effort. “We are coming up with newer vector control methods. We are coming up with new drugs. We are monitoring the drugs that are in use to make sure that they work well and users use them well," said Kimani. "And also, we are coming up with newer strategies to protect the host. And when you do all those things in an integrated fashion we are hoping that at the end of the day we will win against Malaria.” Chaunga said she hopes that more and more people will embrace mosquito nets and embrace modern methods of testing for malaria - further bringing down mortality rates that WHO says are at 47 percent globally and 54 percent in Africa.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 10:27:34 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-test-set-to-be-game-changer-in-eradicating-malaria/2726683.html\n'),
(507, '\nMigrant Deaths in Mediterranean Bring Call for Action\n', '\nInternational and humanitarian agencies are calling for swift action to prevent the deaths of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe.  The latest disaster occurred late Saturday when a boat crammed with up to 700 migrants capsized near Libya.  Only a few dozen survivors have been rescued, though search and rescue missions continue, according to International Organization for Migration spokesman Joel Millman. "The waters are calm and the weather is fair right now, [so] the authorities believe there remains a chance to find people," Millman told VOA. "You know, it is a big sea out there and it is easy not to see people, but ... generally, if someone is missing they are drowned." With the latest incident, the death toll this year will top 1,500, compared with 96 during the first four months of 2014, according to the organization. Most of the migrants making this perilous journey are from sub-Saharan Africa, Eritrea, Somalia and Syria. European Union ministers are discussing possible solutions in Luxembourg. The International Organization for Migration is asking the European Union to once again back life-saving operations on the scale of the Italian-run Mare Nostrum program. That program rescued thousands of migrants at sea, but was shut down last year on the grounds that it encouraged people to risk their lives on smugglers’ boats. Creative response urged Governments must become creative in their search for solutions, IOM spokesman Millman said. "We know places like Agadez in Niger that are full of people on their way to Tripoli," he said. The Sudanese capital of Khartoum "is full of people on their way to Tripoli. "These are very traditional points along the migrant route," he said, where organizations could set up computer-linked stations to register people "and start seeing who has family in one of these countries in Europe who could be qualified for a humanitarian visa, who could be resettled on a temporary basis." Millman acknowledged opening such a channel could provoke a stampede of migrants. But he said a stampede for temporary legal entry to a country was preferable to mass slaughter on the seas. The smugglers’ trade is flourishing in Libya because it is a failed, lawless state. The United Nations is mediating peace talks among warring parties there in an effort to reach a power-sharing agreement that could bring stability and curb human smuggling.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 10:22:09 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/migrant-deaths-in-mediterranean-bring-plea-for-action/2726635.html\n'),

(509, '\nCameroonian Female Scientist Praised for Fighting Stereotypes, Disease\n', '\nCameroonian-born Professor Rose Gana Fomban Leke, winner of the 2011 Kwame Nkrumah Award for the best female scientist in Africa, is being celebrated in Cameroon for advancing research on malaria. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease remains the number one killer in Africa especially among pregnant women. The scholar has worked and published extensively on placental malaria and has broken new ground in clinical care for pregnant women suffering from the disease. Dr. Rose Gana Fomban Leke said that, as a young secondary school (high school) student, she found that many pregnant women were dying of malaria in her community, and she nursed the ambition to one day save lives. Her efforts paid off when, after almost 100 attempts, she finally got funding for malaria research from an American university. "I went to look for where they were doing malaria research and I went to the University of Illinois. When I returned to this country, I wrote grant [applications] to the U.S., I wrote [for] a lot of these competitive grants, finally got a good amount in collaboration with people in Georgetown University to set up a program in malaria during pregnancy," she explained. Malaria-free Dr. Leke founded the non-governmental organization [NGO] Cameroon Coalition Against Malaria, an organization she said aims to sound a trumpet of war against malaria and to drum out a strong message to authorities to adopt appropriate policies and effect change for a malaria free Cameroon. Dr. Leke said as a woman, she did not find it easy convincing her superiors who, for the most part were males. "What I don''t want to put in my mind is this whole thing of woman, you know, because I am a woman there. Sometimes I just keep myself like I am a human being just like the others, we are all doing work and we all move on the way the work has to go,” she said. “Because I have a feeling that sometimes if we over emphasize this thing of woman, that it is because of a woman that they treated me this way, we don''t move. I think it is complementary. I sit with men, they have their own ideas, I can discuss with them at the same level." Pace setter Dr. Leke is today holder of several awards including the 2011 Kwame Nkrumah Award for the best female scientist in Africa. The award recognizes her contribution in malaria research and her work against the scourge, especially among pregnant women. Cameroon''s Minister of Women''s Empowerment and the Family, Marie Theres Abena Ondoua, describes her as a pace setter for women in Cameroon. "She is a complete woman. When they describe what she studied, you say hey, so Cameroonian women can do this. Why do girls not go that far in certain fields? It is because they use to think that those were reserved for men. She was strong enough and she was encouraged to do it. We are no longer in the era where they use to say sciences for boys and literature for girls,” noted Abena. “Girls should know that they can go everywhere and do as much as boys." Encouraging girls to do more Cameroonian society is still very conservative when it comes to women''s promotion and leadership. That is why some people here refer to Dr. Leke as a "man." Journalist Jessy Atogo told me she was not comfortable that. "Men have been there, they are succeeding, you know, so if a woman goes beyond where society thinks she should be then she is a man. But that is not so, I mean we can argue about this till thy kingdom come, but women when they set their minds to do anything they do it,” she stated. “Women have been empowered and endowed by God. We should acknowledge this and said I am who I am, created by God. She can never be forgotten." Dr. Leke believes the best is yet to come for women in her country, but says they should not wait for someone else to make the good things happen. "Don''t give up and devote yourself and not sit and just wait, government has not done this, my goodness. You know what are we doing ourselves in our little corners," she said ." I tell myself I have to keep going, and I think it is a lot of hard work; it is what you will term tenacity. There you work hard and you continue to do so regardless of the challenges. You just keep on going, you don''t stop." The 68 year old professor said she still has lots of ambition and listens to the song "Woman" by the Ugandan-born artist Juliana Kenyomozi for inspiration.\n', 'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 06:53:59 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/rose-gana-fomban-leke-fighting-sterotypes-fighting-disease/2726457.html\n'),

(511, '\nAntibiotic Resistance Found in Isolated Amazonian Tribe\n', '\nPeople with no known contact with Western civilization nonetheless harbored microbes carrying genes that disarm the most modern antibiotics.   That''s one finding from new research in the journal Science Advances that studied the bacteria, fungi and other microbes living in and on Yanomami people in a remote Amazon village. The Yanomami present one of the last chances to see what microbes likely shared our bodies before humans settled down and evolved civilizations. As Western diets and lifestyles spread across the globe, conditions like obesity, diabetes and immune disorders spread with them. Researchers wonder whether the microbes we lost along the way are partly to blame. As concerns grow about the waning power of antibiotics, the new research suggests the seeds of their destruction were carried within us long before humans discovered the lifesaving medications. Uncontacted village The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers living in small villages deep in the Amazon rainforest. Though Westerners first encountered Yanomami people in the 1960s, every year another previously unknown group is spotted in the vast protected area they inhabit. Researchers arrived in one such village in 2008, where residents said they had never seen Westerners before. With their consent and that of their chief, researchers swabbed forearms and mouths and took samples of feces from 34 of the 54 people in the village. Scientists expected to find that the microbes carried some antibiotic-resistance genes. Many soil bacteria produce natural antibiotics to give them an advantage in competitive environments. It’s part of the microbial arms race that’s constantly taking place as other bacteria develop ways to counteract those antibiotics. But the researchers also found nearly as many genes that disarm synthetic drugs that no known microbes produce. “That really was one of the major surprises,” said Gautam Dantas from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, because it shows “they have this ability to rapidly adapt to things we throw at them, maybe even things we don''t think they’ve been exposed to before.” Silent resistance It suggests that even those who haven’t been treated yet are harboring genes that will ultimately defeat these wonder drugs. “It emphasizes the need to ramp up our research for new antibiotics, because otherwise we’re going to lose this battle against infectious diseases,” Dantas said. And, he said, it also shows the need to be more cautious with the antibiotics we have. Doctors are campaigning to reduce the use of the drugs in patients who would recover without them. And they oppose the widespread practice of routinely treating healthy livestock with antibiotics to prevent illness. “You start out with an existing reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes” waiting to be switched on, Dantas said. “And then when you use antibiotics, whether it’s in agriculture or the clinic, you amplify the amounts.” Diverse ecosystem In studying the entire population of microbes inhabiting the Yanomami’s skin and guts, known as their microbiomes, the researchers also found more diversity than in any other people previously studied — more than in Malawians or other Amazonian farmers, for example, and far more than in Americans. “As traditional societies adapt to Western life practices, they are losing many of the benefits entailed by hosting a rich bacterial diversity,” said lead author Jose Clemente at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. For example, he said, the Yanomami carried bacteria that can prevent kidney stones. These bacteria were nearly absent in the other groups studied. “Our study, I think, emphasizes the need to get a better understanding of the microbiota in non-Western populations before their microbial diversity is lost,” Clemente said, “and with it the possibility to find microbes that we still don’t know about that could potentially have therapeutic value.” But how healthy are the Yanomami? Another study by some of the same authors found that Amazonian tribes that had adapted to more Westernized lifestyles had higher rates of obestiy than the Yanomami, but the Yanomami had higher rates of stunting. The World Health Organization considers stunted growth a sign of malnutrition. New science Microbiome science is a brand-new field, with enormous areas of uncertainty. Even the idea that more microbial diversity is healthier is open to debate. “We don’t have any real clear data about that,” noted Stephanie Schnorr of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who was not involved in this research. It''s possible that less microbial diversity makes more sense for people living Westernized lifestyles, who spend less time outdoors and eat cooked, sanitized food. “It may just be that it would be a bit of a drain for us to house such a diverse microbial ecosystem,” she said. “We’d like to say we have some idea. We have an idea that some microbiota are considered beneficial and some aren’t. But that continuously gets disproven, or we have some doubts that are thrown in there.” “It’s really interesting,” Schnoor added. “And it’s great that we have such an open field for a lot of work to be done.”\n', 'Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:05:01 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/antibiotic-resistance-found-isolated-amazonian-tribe/2724182.html\n'),
(512, '\nStudy: Genetically-Engineered Food Bacteria Could Target Cancer\n', '\nMillions of people are sickened each year by the food-borne bacteria, Salmonella. But a genetically-engineered version of the pathogen may someday be used as a weapon against cancer.   Salmonella is the most common bacteria to contaminate food.  Found in undercooked meats, eggs and milk, the microbe can cause severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. One strain of Salmonella is also responsible for typhoid. But researchers in the U.S. and Germany have turned Salmonella into a weapon against cancerous tumors. “Yeah, it causes them to disappear," said Roy Curtiss, a microbiologist at the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University in Tempe. In experiments with mice, Curtiss and colleagues targeted solid tumors grown by human cancer cells, injected into the rodents. He says they used Salmonella bacteria, that had been programmed in the laboratory, to destroy those cells. “We genetically modify the Salmonella so it is unable to survive in healthy tissues, but has a preferential homing to tumors, which [are] a very nutrient-rich environment where they grow like crazy and, in so doing, kill the cancer cells within the tumor," he said. An article describing the work is published in the journal mBio. Curtiss is fascinated with Samonella, which he thinks gets a bad rap. “I’m always looking for new uses for a bug that most people think is an enemy - it’s my friend. And I’d like to make it your friend too," he said. Curtiss’ work has led him to create a vaccine against tuberculosis that he says is more effective against TB than the current BCG vaccine used in many countries to prevent the lung ailment. Researchers have also developed a poultry vaccine that prevents campylobacter in chickens so they are not infected and spread the illness to humans who eat undercooked meat by accident. But Curtiss says it will be a while before the genetically-modified version of Salmonella enters human clinical trials.  He wants to tweak the bacteria further to increase their potency against cancer. Salmonella would not be a stand-alone anti-cancer therapy.  Instead, Curtiss envisions the modified bacteria  being used alongside more traditional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, to fight cancer.\n', 'Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:38:05 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/genetically-emgineered-food-bacteria-targets-cancer/2724085.html\n'),

(518, '\nYemeni Fighters Attack Houthis as Aid Flights Delayed\n', '\nYemeni militias backed by warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition attacked Houthi fighters across several provinces in south Yemen on Monday, driving the Shi''ite rebel forces from some of their positions, witnesses and militia sources said. The southern militias'' gains came on the 12th day of an air campaign by Saudi Arabia and mainly Gulf Arab allies trying to stem advances by the Iran-allied Houthis, who control the capital Sanaa and have advanced on the southern city of Aden. The fighting has killed hundreds of people, cut off water and electricity supplies and led the United Nations children''s agency UNICEF to warn that Yemen is heading towards a humanitarian disaster. Saudi Arabia, the main Sunni Arab power in the Gulf, launched the air campaign on March 26 to try to contain the Shi''ite Houthis and restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled Aden for refuge in Riyadh. The International Committee of the Red Cross and UNICEF plan to fly aid planes into Yemen on Tuesday, but the missions have been delayed as they seek clearance from Arab states waging the airstrikes and hunt for planes prepared to fly to Yemen. In Aden, Houthi forces gathered at the edge of the main port area on Monday but pulled out of two residential quarters on its fringes, residents told Reuters. Around 60 people were killed in heavy fighting in the area on Sunday, they said. Explosions shook Aden''s suburbs. Residents said a foreign warship had shelled Houthi positions on the outskirts, but a spokesman for the coalition in Riyadh said its vessels were helping civilian evacuations, not shelling the Houthis. Military momentum is hard to judge in a disjointed conflict playing out across hundreds of miles of mountains, deserts and coastal positions, but in the southern provinces surrounding Aden the Houthis'' foes said they had made gains. Residents in Dhalea, north of Aden, said airstrikes hit a local government compound on the northern edge of the town and a military base on its outskirts which were both taken over by Houthis. They said buildings were on fire and reported loud explosions. Militia fighters said coalition planes also dropped supplies - the first time they had done so outside Aden - including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, rifles, ammunition, telecommunications equipment and night goggles. Southern militias reported cutting off two roads in Abyan province, east of Aden, leading to the port city, after clashes with the Houthis. Residents near al-Anad air base, once home to U.S. military personnel fighting a covert drone war with al-Qaida in Yemen, said dozens of Houthi and allied fighters were withdrawing north after the site was bombed by coalition jets. Heavy Aden Fighting Saudi Arabia has taken the lead in military operations against the Houthis, backed by air forces from its Gulf allies the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. It says it also has support from Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Morocco and Pakistan. Pakistan has yet to spell out what support it will provide, and its parliament was meeting on Monday to discuss what the defense minister said was a request from Riyadh for military aircraft, warships and soldiers. Street fighting and heavy shelling have torn through Aden for several days. The city is the last bastion of support for the Saudi-backed Hadi, though it is unclear whether the southern fighters are battling for him or for local territory. Food, water and electricity shortages have mounted throughout the country but especially in Aden, where combat has shut ports and cut land routes from the city. "How are we supposed to live without water and electricity?" pleaded Fatima, a housewife walking through the city streets with her young children. She clutched a yellow plastic jerry can, like dozens of other residents on the streets and in queues seeking water from public wells or mosque faucets after supplies at home dried up. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which for days blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays, told Reuters on Monday that Saudi Arabia had granted permission for an aid shipment late on Saturday but problems in chartering planes would likely delay the aid''s arrival until Tuesday. "We are still working on getting the plane to Sanaa. It''s a bit difficult with the logistics because there are not that many companies or cargo planes willing to fly into a conflict zone," said Marie Claire Feghali, a Red Cross spokesperson. The ICRC is aiming to get 48 tons of medical supplies into Yemen by plane. It is also trying to get staff by boat from Djibouti to Aden, but fighting has complicated efforts. "Today fighting was taking place in Aden port so the security situation isn''t getting any better," said another ICRC spokeswoman, Sitar Jabeen. At least eight people were killed in an airstrike before dawn in the suburbs of the northern city of Saadah, home of the Houthi movement which spread from its mountain stronghold to take over the capital Sanaa six months ago. A Houthi spokesman said the dead included women and children. Local officials said strikes also hit air defense and coastal military units near the Red Sea port of Hodaida, and targets on the outskirts of Aden. They also hit a bridge on the road south to Aden, apparently trying to block the Houthis from sending reinforcements to their fighters in the city.

The Pakistani parliament is considering the Saudi request to provide ground troops as well as air and naval support.   The country’s defense minister, Khwaja Muhammad Asif, told parliament on Monday that the country’s decision would “reflect the wishes of the people of Pakistan.”   “I want to reiterate that Pakistan has pledged to defend the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia and, if needed, Pakistan will fulfill this pledge,” he added.   U.S. Takes Neutral Stance   At the U.S. State Department, spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to weigh in on whether Pakistani involvement would be beneficial or destabilizing.   “Every country can make their own decisions about whether to join these kinds of efforts. The same goes for the Pakistanis,” said Harf.   Several Motives Behind Saudi Request   Nabeel Khoury, an analyst at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center does not think Pakistani involvement would be destabilizing. But he says adding Pakistan would be “overkill.”   “All [of] these countries that Saudi Arabia is adding have a more sophisticated military, specifically the Arab countries of Morocco, Jordan and Egypt,” said Khouri.   He said there are other motives behind Saudi Arabia’s decision to reach out to Pakistan.   Saudi Arabia has extended financial assistance to Pakistan to help with its troubled economy. Also, the Saudi royal family provided shelter to Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif after he was ousted in a 1999 military coup.   “Riyadh likes to keep Pakistan on tap,” said Khouri. “They have a special relationship,” he said.   But Schmitz says Saudi Arabia’s decision to try to engage Pakistan may be more of a reflection of its concern about widening Iranian influence in the region.   He said Saudi Arabia is concerned that the nuclear talks that are under way between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany could lead to rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran.   Schmitz said the Saudis are clearly worried about this possible outcome.   He said the Saudi decision to lead the regional coalition fight against the Iran-backed Houthis is a “Saudi defense pact.”   “It is a means for them to assert their ability to defend themselves without the United States, and to not take directions from the United States,” he said.   The U.S. has not indicated that a nuclear deal with Iran would lead to closer engagement with Tehran on other issues.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 19:02:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/saudi-arabaia-strongly-motivated-to-reach-out-to-pakistan/2709297.html\n'),
(520, '\nAmericans Struggle to Get Families Out Amid Yemen Conflict\n', '\nInstead of getting married last Friday, Summer Nasser was in the mountains of Yemen — a twisting, perilous five-hour-drive from her fiancé. The American college student of Yemeni descent is hiding out in her family''s ancestral village with her mother and four siblings, waiting for a break in bombing and rebel clashes before returning — either to their temporary home in Aden, or their real home — New York. The shopkeeper holding onto her wedding dress called last week to say he had also fled the southern port city, as violence accelerated and the Saudi Arabia-led air raids against Houthi rebels showed no sign of relenting. She couldn’t blame him, Nasser said, speaking by phone from the Yafa region. “I did expect some type of security deterioration, but no one expected a 10- country bombardment,” she said. As Saudi Arabia nears a third week of air raids against Houthi rebels in the country, Yemeni-American families who did not get out in time are weighing their options. There aren’t many. Stuck in Yemen Through dozens of alerts over the years, the United States warned Americans living in the country to have contingency plans for emergencies and, unlike Canada, Russia, India and Somalia, has not announced an official evacuation. The U.S. closed its embassy in Sana''a in February. Airports are shut for commercial travel. "We have to make a decision based on the security situation and what is feasible to do," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said at a news conference in Washington last week. "Given the situation in Yemen,," she added, "it''s quite dangerous and unpredictable. Doing something like sending in military assets, even for an evacuation, could put U.S. citizen lives at greater risk." She reiterated on Monday that there were no plans to evacuate Americans. The State Department''s most recent message to citizens in the country on April 5 included information on how to cross into Djibouti by boat. It also indicated that a French cargo ship off the coast of Aden could accommodate a few hundred passengers, but "people will have to find their own way to get out to it," the message said. The United States has evacuated Americans before, though often in situations that escalated without the ongoing warnings as was the case during the 2006 Israeli bombing of the Lebanese capital and when protests against then- President Hosni Mubarak turned deadly in Egypt in 2011. Yemen is a politically complicated country, with ribal and regional allegiances colliding within its borders for decades. Its borders have also changed with the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990. Families in the U.S. and Yemen contacted by VOA agreed that the difference  this time is that until now, they felt that Yemen’s problems were all Yemeni. "There’s always been some kind of threat of some kind. The difference would be, it was always internal … when it’s internal, we don’t consider that to be very dangerous,” said Nasser’s aunt, Sylvia Muchinsky. Muchinsky, working from her home in Brooklyn, New York, is trying to raise awareness of U.S. citizens stranded in Yemen by petitioning the White House “I can’t describe it," she said. "It’s almost like when you live in the ghetto and you see gang violence, you know it’s there. True you can get hit in a drive-by … but it doesn’t really affect you in the day-to-day." "Even during our civil war, people weren’t this afraid," Muchinsky added. "People functioned. A foreign threat is so much more difficult to surmount than an internal threat." Nasser, whose family moved to Yemen last year to save money for the older siblings'' college fees, keeps in touch over mobile phone with other Americans stranded in Yemen. She estimates at least 300 people are in the same situation as her family. Jamal al-Labani was one of them. He was killed by shrapnel from a mortar strike while returning from Friday prayers at a mosque in Aden, his family told U.S. media. Three civil rights organizations in the United States launched the Stuck in Yemen website last week to log cases. “I don''t see [the] State Department doing anything. It’s unfortunate … [The] State Department has a duty to protect you,” said Abed Ayoub, with the Legal and Policy Director at American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), one of the groups involved in the website’s creation. Ayoub said those official alerts aren’t heeded because there are just too many. “Unfortunately, the US has travel warnings in a number of countries, and they''re not taken seriously," he told VOA. "They''ve watered down warnings. It still doesn''t take away from their responsibility to protect US citizens. That doesn''t go away just because they gave a warning or two.” "Just come back" Families are complicated; not everyone agrees how to handle a crisis, or even to what degree there is one. Sarah Alsaidi’s 78-year-old grandfather Mohammed Quhshi returned to Yemen in October to check on family properties, like he often does, and to avoid New York’s winters. Construction is ongoing at one home he is building in Ta’iz, and he is waiting on his son’s building to be vacated at the end of the month, Alsaidi told VOA. He’s pragmatic and invested. His wife, children, and granddaughter — they all want him back in the United States, where he holds citizenship. But people tried to lay claim to his property in Yemen in his absence. Her grandfather wants to make sure the family’s assets are cared for. “My uncle who owns the building told my grandfather ‘I don''t care, just come back,’” said Alsaidi. “Everyone''s been frustrated with him.” Originally scheduled to come home in March, Alsaidi is unsure when he’ll make it to New York. "I knew I couldn''t put any pressure on my grandfather to come back until the airstrikes started ... he missed his opportunity [to leave]," he said. Alsaidi knows he’s prioritizing the properties over his own safety. But she also knows her grandfather’s personality: he’s proud, he’s Yemeni and he has faith that the country will be okay. “If he had the opportunity to leave, I’m not sure he would,” said Alsaidi. Yemen may inspire patriotism, but political inconsistency is a hallmark. In Mohammed Quhshi''s lifetime, he''s seen the formation of two Yemens along north-south lines and political violence that killed thousands of people. Then came reunification, civil war, the rise of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, and the beginning of Western counterterror operations. In the last decade, the Houthi insurgency, deadly bomb attacks, the Arab Spring, and the take-over of the capital by Houthi rebels have continued to cloud the political horizon for a country where more than half the population lives in poverty. Alsaidi said her grandfather is taking a fatalistic view of his current circumstances. "He feels very connected [to Yemen] ... he wants to be safe," she said. "But he thinks that if something horrible were supposed to happen to him, it would happen, he can''t run away from it." She knows that he might be downplaying the situation for his family in New York, but it’s hard to tell. He’s seen the country go through a lot. "He has hopes that Yemen will come around," she said.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 16:08:13 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/americans-struggle-families-yemen-conflict/2708909.html\n'),

Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani, who spoke alongside Abadi, said both sides have agreed to form a committee of military and security experts to see how the collaboration will work. The two men did not lay out a timetable for the plan to retake Nineveh. The announcement comes less than a week after Iraqi special forces assisted by Shi''ite militia and backed by coalition air strikes drove Islamic State fighters out of the city of Tikrit. The battle for Tikrit was seen as a key step toward driving militants out of the city of Mosul, which is about 225 kilometers north of Tikrit and is in Nineveh province.

Idris Nassan, an official in the Kobani canton, said the men were taken on Sunday evening as they were traveling from the town of Afrin, which is under Kurdish control, to the cities of Aleppo and the capital Damascus. "They left women and children but they kidnapped 300 men and young people," he said. "They captured them in Tuqad village, 20 km (12 miles) west of Aleppo and then they moved them to al-Dana town in Idlib province," he said. The Nusra Front was part of an alliance of militant groups that captured Idlib city last month. Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for the Kurdish PYD party in Europe, confirmed that around 300 had been taken but said he did not know which group had taken them. "They were traveling in busses and stopped at a checkpoint. They are civilians. None of them are fighters," he told Reuters by phone from Germany. The Nusra Front has not claimed the kidnapping. Syrian state media did not report the incident. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, which tracks the conflict from Britain, said Kurds were kidnapped but it was not clear how many. Kurdish militia and Islamist militants have fought over territorial disputes in Syria during the four-year-long civil war. Some hardline Syrian Islamist militants consider Kurds heretics.

(525, '\nUN Security Council Condemns Siege of Syria’s Yarmouk Camp\n', '\nThe U.N. Security Council has strongly condemned the siege of a Palestinian refugee camp in the Syrian capital by self-proclaimed Islamic State militants and fighters from the Nusra Front. In an emergency session Monday, the Council called for the protection and safe evacuation of civilians and access for humanitarian aid workers to the approximately 18,000 people still living in the Yarmouk camp. Reports emerged last week that fighters from the two armed groups had seized large parts of the camp on the outskirts of Damascus. The head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), Pierre Krähenbühl, separately briefed both the U.N. Secretary-General and the Security Council via a video link from Amman, Jordan on the developments. Afterwards, he told reporters that the situation in the Yarmouk camp - which was already dire - has deteriorated further and very few civilians have been able to leave. “There are, we believe a few hundreds maybe, maximum, that have been able to leave the camp that we at least can confirm. Yesterday we have been assisting just under a hundred of them that had arrived in one of the neighborhoods just beside Yarmouk, he said. He said prior to the 2011 conflict, Yarmouk was home to about 170,000 Palestinian refugees; only about 10 percent of them remain. Yarmouk has been under Syrian government siege for nearly two years and has received only sporadic aid deliveries. Last Wednesday, media reports said Islamic State and associated armed groups stormed the camp, taking control of most of it. Krähenbühl described the situation as "fluid and volatile." “I think that we can safely say that a significant percentage of the civilians who were inside the camp are now in areas that are controlled by these armed groups,” he said. Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour urged parties to the conflict to spare the Palestinians, saying they have avoided involvement in Syria’s civil war. “We were appealing to all parties - government and opposition -- not to get our people involved and to add more agonies to their on-going tragedy,” said Mansour. The U.N. says before the war started there were about 560,000 Palestinian refugees in Syria. That number has dropped by about 100,000. The UNRWA chief said 95 percent of Palestinians still in the country now fully depend on his agency for assistance. The U.N. Security Council called for safe passage and evacuation of civilians from Yarmouk and said it would look into “further measures” that could be taken to provide the necessary protection and assistance to civilians there.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 10:08:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-un-official-state-of-syrian-refugee-camp-beyond-inhumane/2708356.html\n'),
(527, 'Obama: Iran Deal ‘Once-in-a-Lifetime’ Chance', '\nPresident Barack Obama said the framework nuclear agreement reached last week with Iran represents a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to bring some stability to the Middle East - stability which would be good for Israel as well as other nations.  However, some members of the U.S. Congress remain unconvinced and a key U.S. lawmaker plans to go ahead with legislation requiring Obama to submit any final agreement to Congress for debate and a vote. Speaking to The New York Times Sunday, Obama said he would consider it a fundamental failure of his presidency, if, on his watch or as a consequence of work that he has done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable. He said that would be not just a strategic failure, but a moral failure. Message to Israeli people Asked what his message is to the Israeli people about the agreement, the president said that while they have a right to be concerned about Iran, they should be equally concerned Iran is not able to acquire nuclear weapons. He said there is no better option to ensure that doesn’t happen than the framework agreement reached in Switzerland. The framework is an outline to be used during subsequent negotiations on a final agreement by the end of June. “Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch,” Obama said. But he also expressed hope this diplomatic arrangement can “usher in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations” and a new era in Tehran’s relations with its neighbors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on U.S. television Sunday, called the framework agreement a “bad deal” that gives Iran “a free path to the bomb.” “It leaves the pre-eminent terrorist state of our time with a vast nuclear infrastructure. Remember, not one centrifuge is destroyed. Thousands of centrifuges will be left spinning uranium. Not a single [nuclear] facility, including underground facilities, is being shut down. "This is a deal that leaves Iran the capacity to produce the material for many, many nuclear bombs. It does so by lifting the sanctions pretty much upfront. So, Iran will have billions of dollars flowing into its coffers not for schools, or hospitals, or roads, but to pump up its worldwide terror machine and its military machine, which is busy conquering the Middle East, as we speak,” Netanyahu said. He said this is not a partisan issue, or just an Israeli issue, it is a world issue because everyone will be threatened by nuclear-armed Iran. Stringent restrictions U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who took part in the negotiations, said the agreement will give the international community “almost instantaneous” recognition of any attempt by Iran to evade the deal. Moniz called it a long-term arrangement. “There is no sunset. There will be a lot of phases starting with extremely stringent restrictions on Iran’s program. Hopefully, they will comply for a long time, build up confidence. But, we have 10-year restrictions, 15-year restrictions, 25-year restrictions, and we have forever-restrictions. So, this is a long-term program, not something that will go away in a few years,” he said. Moniz said the agreement calls for unprecedented access to Iran’s nuclear program, not just declared sites, but to any covert aspects of their infrastructure. Many unkowns The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee’s Bob Corker, said many details of the agreement are not yet known, making it difficult to determine if this is a good or bad agreement. He said there appear to be discrepancies on how sanctions will be relieved. He also wants to know how snap inspections will be conducted on covert aspects of Iran’s nuclear program, as well as its military dimensions. “Again, I’m open. I know there will be a lot of details worked out over the next several months. That’s why, on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to be playing a role. What the American people may not know right now is that there will be all kinds of classified annexes that are very important. "They lay out the details as to how much of this is going to take place. And, that’s why it’s so important that Congress play its rightful role in approving this prior to the congressionally-mandated sanctions that we put in place are alleviated,” said Corker. Corker said his committee will go ahead with plans to vote April 14 on legislation requiring the president to submit a final agreement to Congress for debate and a vote. It would prohibit Obama from suspending sanctions during a 60-day congressional review. However, he acknowledged he is uncertain if he has the required 67 votes in the 100-seat chamber to override a presidential veto.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:01:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/obama-iran-nuclear-agreement-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity/2708079.html\n'),
(528, '\nReport: Obama Promises ‘Tough Conversation’ With Arab Allies Over Security\n', '\nPresident Barack Obama said he would have a "tough conversation" with America''s Gulf Arab allies in which he would promise strong U.S. support against external enemies but tell them they must address internal political challenges. In an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman published on Sunday, he said he would tell Gulf states they also needed to be more active in addressing regional crises. "I think when you look at what happens in Syria, for example, there''s been a great desire for the United States to get in there and do something," he said in the interview, conducted on Saturday. "But the question is: Why is it that we can''t have Arabs fighting the terrible human rights abuses that have been perpetrated, or fighting against what Assad has done?" he added, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama said last week he would meet the leaders of the six Gulf Cooperation Council states this spring at his Camp David retreat outside Washington, partly to discuss their concerns about the emerging nuclear agreement with Iran. The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Saudi Arabia, which sees Iran as its main regional rival, has repeatedly hinted that it would seek its own atomic weapons if Tehran ever did the same. Gulf states are part of the U.S.-led coalition campaigning against Islamic State militants who have taken over large parts of Syria and Iraq. Obama said he wanted to discuss with the Gulf allies how to build more effective defense capabilities and assure them of U.S. support against outside attack. "...that perhaps will ease some of their concerns and allow them to have a more fruitful conversation with the Iranians," he said. But the president said their biggest danger came not from a possible attack from Iran but from dissatisfaction inside their own countries, including from alienated, unemployed youth and a sense that there was no political outlet for grievances. So as well as giving military support, the United States must ask: "How can we strengthen the body politic in these countries, so that Sunni youth feel that they''ve got something other than (the Islamic State) to choose from," Obama said. "That''s a tough conversation to have, but it''s one that we have to have," he said.\n', 'Sun, 05 Apr 2015 20:49:04 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/report-says-obama-promises-tough-conversation-with-arab-allies-over-security/2707999.html\n'),

(530, 'Global Chatter Continues on Iran Nuclear Accord', '\nThursday’s landmark political accord on Iran’s nuclear program remains a focal point of commentary around the world.  Debate on the preliminary deal will likely consume Washington when Congress reconvenes next week. In Easter Sunday prayers, Pope Francis highlighted the accord reached in Switzerland. “With hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world.” China’s Foreign Ministry called the deal “good news for the world.”  By contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains a fierce critic of the agreement. “This is a bad deal," said Netanyahu. "It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure.  I think, for the preeminent terrorist state of our time to have a free path, an easy path to nuclear weapons endangers Israel, endangers the region, endangers the world.” While the accord mandates sanctions relief in return for restrictions on Iran’s atomic capabilities, it does not mean a surrender of U.S. and international leverage over Iran, according to President Barack Obama. “Many key details will need to be finalized over the next three months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed," said Obama. "And if there is backsliding, there will be no deal.  If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back in place.  Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, all will continue to be enforced.” While pledging to abide by promises made, Iranian officials make clear they expect a full and permanent end to sanctions that have battered their nation’s economy for years.  But terminating, as opposed to suspending, some U.S.-imposed measures would require an act of Congress, and many in the Republican-led body remain skeptical, or even hostile, to the framework accord, meaning that the White House has work to do. “Here in the United States, I expect robust debate," said Obama. "We will keep Congress and the American people fully briefed on the substance of the deal.  As president and commander-in-chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option - comprehensive, long-term deal like this - is by far the best option.” Polls show most Americans open to a negotiated settlement on Iran’s nuclear program, and many lawmakers are in their home districts meeting with constituents.

Since then, it has become the second most popular path into Western Europe, after the option of sailing from North Africa to Italy. A group of more than 40 men, women and children arrived in Greece earlier this year, after a long and arduous journey from their countries to Turkey. In Turkey, they paid $500 each for a passage across the sea. Their leader, a man from Ivory Coast, agreed to pilot their overloaded boat to a Greek island in exchange for free passage. He is now leading the group through Macedonia along railway tracks. Hungarian borders The group''s destination is Hungary, from where migrants can enter Germany, France or some other Western European country without a visa or a passport. Jean-Paul Apetey, 34, of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said, "Really, you have to have the courage because there are many obstacles. The journey has many aspects, because Europe is huge. You think you just go to France, but before arriving there you have to walk thousands of ways." People in this group are from Ivory Coast, Mali, Cameroon and Burkina Faso. The trek through the unknown is fraught with obstacles and danger. But they say the risk is worth it because at the end of the road, there is hope for a new life. Fidel Castro Chimana, 31, of Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, said, "Most of us, we are from Africa and we have many problems in our continent - bad economics, bad politics, bad work, so you can get a diploma and you don''t find work." Frontex, the European Union agency charged with helping the bloc''s countries seal their leaky borders, said more than 43,000 illegal crossings were made via the western Balkans route in 2014, more than double the year before. In the first two months of this year, there have been 22,000 confirmed arrivals in Hungary by that route. Hilarion Charlemagne, 45, of Ivory Coast, said, "We know that when we cross the border it''s against the law. This we understand.

(539, '\nDeath Knell or New Beginning for Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood?\n', '\nIn 2012, newly elected President Mohamed Morsi promised Egypt had chosen a government that was Islamic, but inclusive. Democratic, yet not slavishly pro-Western.   Now, Morsi, sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in prison, is incarcerated along with thousands of his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.  The government that succeeded Morsi''s branded the Brotherhood a terrorist group.  Security forces killed hundreds of other members in the streets.  Hundreds more, including some of the leadership, await the death penalty.    Egyptian authorities say the Brotherhood has allied with terrorist organizations that have killed hundreds of police and soldiers, as well as civilians in the past year and a half.  "Leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood who have fled the country are changing their rhetoric and officially abandoning their commitment to peaceful movements," said Interior Ministry spokesman Hany Abdel-Latif, according to the semi-official leading Egyptian daily Al Ahram. Muslim Brotherhood leaders abroad say the organization is still strong and that a new generation of young leaders is emerging to replace the incarcerated and those killed.   “His trial has been a travesty of justice, which has been scripted and controlled by the government and entirely unsupported by evidence,” said Amr Darrag, a leader of Morsi’s political party, the Freedom and Justice Party, in a statement from Istanbul.  Hours later, he told reporters the Brotherhood would always consider currently jailed leaders their leaders, but new men are coming up because “to run affairs … you have to be outside and at the heart of events.” Down for now, or forever? Some analysts, however, see Morsi''s sentencing as the beginning of the end for the Brotherhood in Egypt as we know it. Darrag''s claim could be the last gasp of breath for a dying organization, killed by its own ambitions, according to Mohamed Salah, who heads the Cairo bureau for the London-based newspaper Al Hayat. “Now the Brotherhood has not only lost power politically, but it has lost the public’s trust,” Salah said. “They are good at opposition.  But at ruling?  They are a complete failure.” The loss of power and popularity may be temporary, according to other observers.  The Brotherhood is not just good at opposition; they are masters, with a particular talent for endurance, said Fahmy Howeidy, a prominent Egyptian columnist.   Using a mix of charity and piety, the Brotherhood has long been popular among the poor in Egypt and is still viewed by many as a persecuted religious group, not a violent extremist movement. “It is difficult to say that when they were banned by law, that everything would be finished, they would close,” Howeidy said. “For more than 80 years they have been here, and they will continue.” An emerging power Technically banned during ousted President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule, the Brotherhood nonetheless grew deep roots, emerging as the strongest, most organized and easily the richest party after the 2011 uprising. That''s because Mubarak’s ban wasn’t absolute, Howeidy said. In 2005, Muslim Brotherhood members won 20 percent of the seats in parliament.  That show of force prompted a government crackdown. After Mubarak fell, Brotherhood candidates took half the seats in parliament.  The following year, Morsi won a hotly contested — but generally recognized as fair — election by 51 percent of the vote. But Morsi''s rule quickly became unpopular.  The president failed to deliver on promised improvements in basic services, in part because he was unable to secure an alliance with members of the "deep state" — an elite group that long held power behind the scenes.  Power cuts, fuel shortages and media-fueled false rumors of Morsi''s goals put the nation on edge. Popular protests grew when he overrode the constitution to assume extraordinary powers.  One year into his presidency, the streets were packed with hundreds of thousands of people rallying against him, and a military, led by then-Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, ready to step in and remove Morsi from power. The aftermath The victors in the drama called it a “second revolution,” but the Muslim Brotherhood did not go quietly.  Thousands stayed on the streets in makeshift protest camps.  After six weeks, the military said it had had enough, and the camps were razed by government troops and police.  Hundreds of protesters died. The nation seemed polarized, with Sissi heralded by many, loathed by others.  Foreign media were demonized, while Egyptian media mostly fell in line with the new government.  Those journalists who didn''t often faced arrest.  Soon, many of the anti-Mubarak protesters of 2011 did, too. Some liberals who celebrated after successfully toppling two governments were stunned.  “I felt like I just woke up,” said Mohammad, a self-described former activist, deeply disappointed by the outcome of both uprisings.   In his enthusiasm to oust Morsi, Mohammad said he didn’t expect a military takeover.  He just wanted an end to what he called “religious dictatorship.”   Looking back, he added, he should have seen it coming: That is what happened after Mubarak fell — the military took over. “In that time I was brainwashed,” he said, referring to the initial euphoria after Morsi’s fall.  The “media did it for me, and others.”  Mohammad has never been a fan of the Brotherhood, but when asked how he feels about Morsi’s conviction, he said of course it was wrong: "People voted for him." Fate of democracy Mohammad isn’t alone in his disappointment, wondering about the future of Egypt’s democracy as Mubarak has mostly evaded the hand of justice while Morsi remains in prison. Complicating matters is a strong government and media effort to conflate the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadist violence sweeping parts of Egypt and the region. The anti-Muslim Brotherhood sentiment in Egypt is at an all-time high, said Howeidy, but the national mood could shift again. “The majority are against the Brotherhood now,” he said.  “But this could be changed because the media is playing a great role in changing minds.”  If and when the mood changes, he added, some convicted Muslim Brotherhood members may simply go free.  “From our experience, they will let them go out after a few years.”   The real test to Egypt’s democracy, said Howeidy, will not be the crackdown conviction rate, but whether enough political space can open up to incorporate what will be the next generation of the Brotherhood. But is the Muslim Brotherhood a political and religious group that should be incorporated into Egyptian political space, or is it a band of extremists?  Recent violence, including street clashes and increasingly frequent bombings, suggest the latter, according to Salah of Al Hayat. “One opportunity after another came their way to be part of the Egyptian political scene, but the Brotherhood leadership preferred to behave with violence," he said.  "Not just against the authorities, but against the people.” Claim of "self-defense" The government, while repeatedly blaming the Brotherhood, has offered little evidence linking violence to the group.  The Brotherhood denies the claims and says any violence on its part was always "self-defense" against attacks. The current government’s human rights record has been criticized sharply, with Morsi’s conviction being called a “travesty of justice” by Amnesty International. For many Egyptians, however, the government’s first job is to stabilize the economy and restore order after four years of chaos, leaving human rights an issue for another, more peaceful day.  And since formally taking power nearly a year ago, Sissi has also had more pressing items on the agenda than ensuring rights for his political archenemies, according to Carool Kersten, a senior lecturer on Islam at King’s College in London. “His main concerns were to establish his credibility, ensure the security situation,” he said.  “And at least give some semblance of stability in terms of getting the political process on the rails.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:22:26 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/death-knell-new-beginning-egypt-muslim-brotherhood/2730737.html\n'),
(541, '\nUS Lawmakers Urge Tough Stance as Iran Nuclear Talks Resume\n', '\nHouse lawmakers on Wednesday called for U.S. negotiators to be tough with Iran, as talks resumed to finalize the details of a landmark framework deal aimed at curbing the scope of Tehran’s nuclear programs. Iran and the other countries in the talks — China, France, Russia, Britain, the United States and Germany — reached a tentative deal on April 2 and now aim to finalize the details by the end of June. Though the deal was hailed as a breakthrough, serious differences remain about its specifics, including when the crippling economic sanctions imposed by Western nations will be lifted. At a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers expressed concern about recent statements by Iran''s supreme leader saying Tehran would never grant weapons inspectors access to its military sites. Both Republican and Democratic House members called on the United States to be tough during the new talks and to demand access for international weapons inspectors to any facilities they consider suspicious. “The key here … is this ability to get to this issue of verification. The opportunity to go into these sites – that the Iranians are calling military sites – and they’re saying because these are military sites, you cannot have access to them,” Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the committee, told VOA after the hearing. “Well, clearly they already have weaponization occurring at one of these sites and so it’s necessary for the negotiators to hold their position, that inspectors will have the ability to go in and inspect.” Iran has long insisted its nuclear programs are peaceful, intended for civilian purposes like research, medicine and power generation. The United States, Israel and others, however, suspect the scope of Tehran’s uranium enrichment efforts indicates Iran is seeking to build bombs. Royce also signaled concern about what Iran might do in the interim period when sanctions were being lifted, suggesting new revenues might end up funding Iranian organizations like the Revolutionary Guard, and be transferred to terror groups like Hamas. The framework deal lays out broad conditions for international inspectors to gain access to some Iranian nuclear sites. David Albright, a well-known nuclear weapons expert, said the question now is how intrusive the inspection regime will be. “I don’t think [the Iranians] want to comply. I think they want to have the weakest inspection arrangement as possible. I mean, they write about it," he told VOA. "They’ve made very public statements they don’t want inspectors at military sites. But, these things are not acceptable if they want a deal.” “And I think they will cave on that, but the question is will they give enough that the verification effort, which has to be intrusive, will be adequate," he said. There''s also the question about setting up a mechanism to re-impose sanctions, if Tehran is found to be not complying with the deal, Albright said.  “That’s very difficult and I’m not sure it’s even known how you do it effectively, particularly if you’re talking about U.N. Security Council sanctions. So, I think there’s some real tough work there,” he said. “And, I would imagine Iran is going to resist.” The resumption in talks have been clouded by other political issues involving Iran, including Tehran’s alleged funneling of weapons to Shi''ite Houthi rebels in Yemen. The United States said it has evidence Iran has given weapons and has sent U.S. warships to the Yemen coast. Also clouding the talks is the issue of detained and missing U.S. citizens in Iran. That includes Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been detained in Iran for more than six months.    U.S. officials, however, said this will be brought up separately from the nuclear talks. "We will raise this directly with Iran, push for their release, push for them to be able to come home with their families right away," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. "We are clear about our concerns, obviously, about these citizens, very very directly with the Iranians."\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 15:56:45 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/us-congress-iran-nuclear-talks/2730652.html\n'),
(542, '\nAirstrikes in Syria Leave at Least 32 Dead, Activists Say\n', '\nSyrian government aircraft bombed rebel-held areas in the capital''s suburbs and a northern town and surrounding villages controlled by the Islamic State group, including a strike on a local hospital, killing at least 32 people Wednesday, activists said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the airstrikes on the hospital in Dayr Hafir and surrounding villages in the northern province of Aleppo killed at least 15 people, including medical staff, women and children, and wounded at least 40. The group said the casualty figures were likely to rise. Activist Abu al-Hassan Marea, who is based near the town, told The Associated Press that the airstrikes on Dayr Hafir''s hospital killed at least 21 people, mostly civilians and medics. The Aleppo Media Center activist group said the strike on the hospital killed 23, mostly civilians. Marea and the Local Coordination Committees, an activist group that tracks the Syrian civil war, said another airstrike on a nearby village, also held by Islamic State fighters, killed seven people. The Observatory put the toll from that strike at six civilians. The discrepancies in the casualty figures could not be immediately reconciled. Aleppo, once Syria''s commercial center, has been carved up into areas controlled by the government and others controlled by an array of rebels since an opposition offensive in mid-2012. Long a stronghold for Syrian rebels, the area, a strategic stretch because of its proximity to the Turkish border, has been a flash point since the Islamic State group advanced into the region several months ago. Also Wednesday, the Observatory said government airstrikes killed at least 11 people, including two women, in rebel-held areas in the suburbs of the capital, Damascus, and wounded others. The Local Coordination Committees also said 11 people from the suburbs Harasta and Douma had been killed, including the two women. The government repeatedly has targeted rebel strongholds in the capital''s suburbs.

(543, 'Yemen Faces Humanitarian Catastrophe', '\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says the humanitarian situation in Yemen is nothing short of catastrophic. The Red Cross reports since Saudi Arabia launched its air campaign on March 26, violence has escalated and conditions for millions of civilians in Yemen have dramatically deteriorated. The head of ICRC operations for the Near and Middle East, Robert Mardini, has just returned from a three-day visit to the capital, Sana’a, and bears witness to the grim reality of life in Yemen. He says the resilience of the Yemeni people has been eroded to the breaking point and that people are ill equipped to cope with the current situation and its aftermath. “Nowhere is safe in Yemen today," he said. "Nearly a month of death and destruction after years of crisis leaves little hope for Yemenis to lead a normal life. At least 50 people were killed and 200 wounded every day since 26 March. The recent reports we got from our teams from Aden, Sana''a and Taiz are alarming. Tens of thousands have been displaced and sought shelter in schools and mosques … hundreds have been arrested.” Property, infrastructure damage Mardini describes the damage to property and infrastructure by the airstrikes and ground fighting as absolutely shocking. He says indiscriminate shootings are a constant threat to the entire population. He also says aid workers and ambulances are under attack, noting that three Red Crescent volunteers have been killed and two wounded in the line of duty since March 26. He says many hospitals are open, but lack medicines and medical staff as the number of wounded is rising. He says millions of people are short of basic goods and services. They lack food, water, fuel and drugs - and this is leading to soaring prices for the most basic commodities. Despite the many hardships and multiple threats facing its staff, Mardini says the ICRC will not be deterred from carrying out its humanitarian operations. He says the Red Cross plans to scale up its activities. "We made the deliberate choice to keep our teams present and operational since 26 March," he explained. "Going forward, we will pursue our efforts and further reinforce our presence and action. We will continue to act as a neutral intermediary to ensure safe movement of trapped civilians. We will continue our support to hospitals and health structures. We will do more to meet peoples’ need for food and water. We will continue to work with the local water authorities to keep the water flowing and backup power facilities running.” Appeal for emergency response The International Committee of the Red Cross is launching a preliminary $15 million appeal to cover this emergency response. This is in addition to the nearly $29 million it has already budgeted for its operations in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has said it is ending its airstrikes in Yemen. Mardini says this offers a glimmer of hope, if confirmed, adding that military action will not achieve peace, only a political solution could do that. As of now, he says, he is not very optimistic about the outlook for Yemen and its beleaguered population.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:57:02 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/yemen-facing-humanitarian-catastrophe/2730307.html\n'),
(544, '\nEgypt Reforms School Textbooks to Counter Extremism\n', '\nEgypt’s Ministry of Education is removing from primary and secondary school curricula some religious texts and passages on historical Islamic figures including Saladin, the 12th century Muslim ruler who confronted the Crusaders and is widely viewed as an iconic hero in the Arab world. The changes to primary and secondary school curricula, being touted by government ministers as a bid to counter radical Islamic ideologies, is provoking the ire of Islamists in the country. Salafists say the deletions recommended by a curriculum development panel set up in March amount to the government declaring war on Islam. But the Prime Minister, Ibrahim Mehleb, who has endorsed the recommendations made after a brief review of textbooks says jihadists are exploiting outdated ideas to incite youngsters to violence. Another historical figure getting deleted is Uqba ibn Nafi, the seventh century Arab general who led the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb for the Umayyad dynasty. According to legend, one of Uqba''s soldiers stumbled across a golden goblet that had disappeared from Mecca, buried in the Tunisian sands and when he dug it up a spring appeared, the waters of which were said to have come from the sacred Zamzam Well in Saudi Arabia. Some fatwas and Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad) are also being omitted, including one saying, “I was ordered to fight people until they testify that there is no god but Allah.” The leader of the Salafist Nour Party, Younis Makhyoun, has condemned the removal of Saladin and Uqba Ibn Nafi as “an assault on our history, an alteration of our identity and a surrender to our enemies.” And Yasser al-Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call party, has called for the omissions to be restored, especially the story of Saladin, who liberated Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. In a press statement he said: “The ministry does not have the right to ’alter the nations history and the biography of the Prophet just because it has illusions about them and under the pretext that these stories incite violence and killing. How do they have the audacity to delete the words of the Quran?” But the country’s education ministry says, “Some of the material was inciting violence and was first entered into the curriculum during the Muslim Brotherhood''s era.” Officials say the censoring of material used to encourage violence is part of a larger ideological battle the government is determined to wage against Islamic extremism. This isn’t the first time the Egyptian government headed by former army commander President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has removed content from national textbooks. This is the second round of changes since the Sissi-led army toppled Egypt''s first freely-elected civilian President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood after protests against his one-year rule. In January, the education ministry oversaw changes in school psychology and sociology curricula and texts that, in their turn, had been altered previously by the Muslim Brotherhood government. One high school course removed was “The Difference Between a Revolution and a Coup.” Textbooks that include biographies of Islamist leaders were pulped and reprinted after amendments were made. The changes are in line with a controversial speech the Egyptian president gave earlier this year before an audience of leading religious scholars calling for a “religious revolution” in Egypt. He said dominant Islamic thought had become too closed and antagonistic to the world. “It’s inconceivable that the thought that we hold most sacred should cause the entire nation to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,” he told the scholars. President el-Sissi said Islam wasn’t the problem per se. The problem lay with “that corpus of texts and ideas that we have sanctified over the centuries, to the point that departing from them has become almost impossible.” Some Egyptian historians and academics are critical of the latest textbook and curricula changes, warning that censorship distorts history. Or they argue far more serious strategic consideration should be given to the shaping of school curricula and education reform rather than piecemeal changes. “Egypt’s current educational system is an incubator for extremism and radicalization,” says Samuel Tadros, an analyst with the Hudson Institute, a U.S. research organization. In a report published this month, he argued: “Attempting to address the question of intolerance, radicalization, and extremism in the Egyptian educational system must begin by addressing the very structure of that system and not merely changing curricula.” He advocates retraining teachers and bringing under government control the country’s largest and most influential university, Al Azhar. Students studying at Al Azhar are “the most prone to radicalization among Egyptian students and are heavily exposed and indoctrinated in texts that increase intolerance of non-Muslims and the world,” he argues. In Egypt, and across the region, textbooks and curricula are regularly altered to reflect prevailing political opinion and the ideology of those in power. In Libya, after the ouster of strongman Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, there was little effort to write accurate history to replace the distortions contained in the school and university curricula during his 42-year-long dictatorship.   The new rulers just wanted to forget the Gadhafi past and Islamists and progressives alike were eager to put their spin on the country’s history as they maneuvered to define the new Libya. Chapters on the Gadhafi years were just torn out of history textbooks. Even before the Arab spring and its aftermath, Egyptian rulers have shaped curricula and textbooks to promote their ideas, glorify themselves and denigrate predecessors. During the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser his predecessor the first president of the Egyptian republic, Mohammad Naguib, who he ousted, slowly disappeared from the nation’s history books. And during the rule of Anwar Sadat the importance of the 1952 coup that overthrew the country’s monarchy increasingly was played down in school textbooks to be replaced in significance by the 1973 October War against Israel.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:19:36 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/egypt-reforms-school-textbooks-to-counter-extremism/2730247.html\n'),
(545, '\nIran Seeks China''s Help to Build New Nuclear Plants\n', '\nThe framework nuclear deal between Iran and global powers has opened up new investment possibilities in an economy that has been stunted by international sanctions. Last week, a top Iranian atomic energy official said in addition to Russia, China will also help it build additional nuclear power plants. China has not commented on the proposal, but Iran says Beijing could help it build at least three nuclear plants in the coastal city Bushehr.   The city is home to Iran’s first nuclear plant, the construction of which began four decades ago.   Germany started work there in the 1970s, but that effort was halted during Iran’s Islamic Revolution. After that, Russia took over in the 1990s, but it was not until 2013 the plant was operating at full capacity.   Oil-rich Iran says it needs nuclear power to meet its energy needs. Uranium fuels nuclear reactors, but can also be used to make nuclear bombs. Iran and world powers are seeking to reach final agreement on a deal by late June.   Chinese expertise China Center for Energy Economic Research at Xiamen University Director Lin Boqiang says China is well positioned to be a key player in Iran’s nuclear energy program.   Lin says, “China has great strength when it comes to the construction of power plants, given that most of the new plants being built in the world today are in China.” He says “the export of nuclear energy is also something that is essential to the transitioning of the Chinese economy.”   Late last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time approved a Chinese-designed reactor, giving it the green light for domestic production as well as exports.   Last week, the Chinese government approved the construction of the country’s first third-generation nuclear reactor, the Hualong One.   China is trying to build up its own brand of reactors, says Matthew Cottee, a research analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Program.   “The Hualong One is currently being built in China, but it is going to take a while for the international community to have some trust in a new nuclear reactor that has not been built anywhere else,” he said.   Analysts say that first reactor could take six to eight years to build, but China is already exporting the technology abroad.   Chinese media say a power station under development in Karachi, Pakistan could be the first Hualong One built outside China, and Argentina also has agreed on a deal to build one in the South American country. Beijing also has a bilateral deal with Romania and a potential deal with Turkey.   Possible joint ventures If China carries through on building reactors in Iran, it could partner with another foreign country to mitigate the political risk of such a sensitive project.   “Whether China will be the only country in such a cooperation or whether the Chinese involvement in such nuclear power construction will be in kind of a like a consortium, such as a French company for example, is not yet clear,” said Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies.   China is already eyeing multi-nation deals to help it break into lucrative foreign markets that could be wary of partnering solely with Beijing.   Analyst Matthew Cottee points to a nuclear power project in Britain that may use Chinese financial backing and French designs.   “If the reactor is built at Hinckley Point in Somerset in the U.K. that will be potentially involving some Chinese funding. But if you look at the memorandum of understanding between the U.K. and China, it kind of paves the way for a potential Chinese indigenous technology to actually be constructed in the U.K.,” said Cottee.   On Tuesday, President Barack Obama proposed a 30-year agreement to cooperate with China on nuclear power. If approved by the U.S. Congress, the deal would allow the transfer of material, reactors, components and technology between the two countries.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:02:00 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/iran-seeks-china-help-to-build-new-nuclear-plants/2730146.html\n'),

Some demonstrators hurled stones and police fired teargas as protesters rallied in Meskel Square at dawn to denounce Islamic State. “We will not bow down to terrorism!” one placard carried by a young boy said. Another read: “The world must be united against terrorism.” The demonstration marked the start of a three-day mourning period in the East African country. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was among the officials and religious leaders who addressed the gathering. The prime minister urged Ethiopians not to travel across the Sahara to reach Europe. “We should strengthen our resolve against any form of terrorism and extremism,” he added. Although Ethiopia''s economy is growing fast, unemployment remains high. Many opt to trek across the desert via Libya, where Islamic State militants have gained a toehold after seizing large parts of Syria and Iraq. Ethiopia has confirmed that those killed in the video, posted Saturday, were its citizens. Family members and friends of the victims were given special attention during the event.  Aheza Kahesai, the mother of one the victims, said she found out her child was killed when someone else told her they had seen her son on television. Her 38-year old son left two months ago saying he had found a job as a driver overseas. One man at the government-organized rally, who said he was a university professor, said many in the crowd were angry that jobless Ethiopians still felt they had to travel to places like Libya in the hope of crossing over to a better life in Europe. He also accused the authorities of clamping down on free speech. “Even the chanting [at the rally] was led by the government,” he said. “We do not have the power to speak.” The atmosphere changed when parts of the crowd began to voice the dissatisfaction of many toward the government''s response not only to the Libya killings, but also to the lack of action to help Ethiopians caught up in the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. Authorities then dispersed the crowds, with police using sticks and firing a few rounds of tear gas to clear out the main square. Dozens were taken into custody, and some wounded demonstrators and police were taken to the hospital. Less than two hours later everything was back to normal. Ethiopia''s government dismisses accusations from rights groups that it stifles critics and opponents. But a 31-year-old student who requested anonymity had tears in his eyes as he viewed the scene Wednesday.  He said he understands people''s frustration because the Ethiopian government doesn’t allow its citizens to express their feelings.   “The first thing the government should ask is why people are migrating. There are a lot of challenges here. I want to ask the government to search what is the problem of society to get out of their countries,” he said. Ethiopia has a long history of Muslims and Christians living peacefully side-by-side, so the killings have stunned the many. Muslims make up about 40 percent of the population, according to government statistics, with followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church being the majority. Muslim lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday read out verses in the Koran preaching tolerance. “I am in pain.

The instability in Yemen requires much more work there and in the entire  Middle East region, the White House said Wednesday. "Obviously, the job is not done," Jen Psaki, White House communications director, said on CNN. " ... There''s a lot of work that needs to be done and we''re going to be doubling down and continuing to work on that with our partners around the world.'''' Yemeni officials said coalition forces on Wednesday struck at Houthi rebels in Taiz, Yemen''s third-largest city. The rebels had seized control of a military brigade headquarters near the old airport to the city''s southeast. Airstrikes also hit the southern port city of Aden, blasting rebel forces in outlying districts there. Street fighting continued in both cities, especially Taiz, where combat with rebels left dozens killed on both sides. The Houthis on Wednesday called for a return to U.N.-sponsored peace talks to resolve the conflict. In New York, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations stood ready to play any role to facilitate the peace negotiations. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the U.N.-supported diplomatic process "remains the best way out of a drawn-out war with terrifying implications for regional stability." Saudi Arabia''s leading role against the Houthis has turned Yemen into the latest theater of a regional proxy conflict between the Gulf''s leading Sunni Muslim and Shi''ite Muslim powers — a struggle also playing out in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. According to the World Health Organization, 1,080 people have been killed and 4,352 wounded over the past month in Yemen. Earlier Wednesday morning, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan had encouraged using the declared pause in air raids to discuss a diplomatic resolution to the upheaval. "We strongly urge all Yemeni parties, in particular the Houthis and their supporters, to take this opportunity to return to these negotiations as part of the political dialogue," Meehan said in a statement that also praised Saudi Arabia''s $274 million commitment of humanitarian relief for Yemen. Psaki reiterated that goal in her CNN interview. "There is no other solution that''s going to work,'''' she said. "This is not a war that can be fought on the battlefield.'''' Meehan''s statement also said the U.S. would "continue to closely monitor terrorist threats posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and to take action as necessary to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the United States and our citizens."   Saudi Arabia on Tuesday had declared the end of its monthlong bombing campaign aimed at halting the Houthis'' advance, but said its new focus on supporting a political solution also could include actions to prevent the rebels from acquiring or using weapons from Yemen''s military. A Saudi statement also prioritized resuming U.N.-led peace talks concerning Yemen. Hadi speech In Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Yemen''s exiled president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, gave a televised address saying the crisis in his country would end "soon." He also thanked the Saudi-led coalition and said his government would restore hope to Yemen''s people. "I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people," Hadi said.  "The alliance ... supported [the government''s] legitimacy, which responded to the calls of Yemenis to serve its interests," Hadi said, adding the people "are looking to live and restore their state." That''s "the primary objective of Operation Decisive Storm," he said of the Saudi-led strikes. Iran Iran, which supports the Houthis, had welcomed the declared halt to airstrikes as the end to "killing innocent and defenseless civilians" and called the move a "step forward" toward a political resolution. President Barack Obama on Tuesday said the U.S. government had told Iran that any weapons shipments to the Houthis would be a "problem." "We''re not sending obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it," Obama said in an interview on MSNBC''s "Hardball" with Chris Matthews.

(549, '\nFamilies Deny Somali-American Men Linked to Islamic State\n', '\nThe families of six Somali-American men arrested for allegedly planning to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State militant group deny the accusations. The men have been charged with conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization. The mother of two of the men, Mohamed Farah and Adnan Farah, said she knew nothing of the accusations until the FBI raided her home Sunday to detain one of her sons. “Until now I don’t know about the charges. The FBI raided our house, they held pistols at us, they herded us in the living room and then they asked us about Mohamed and Adnan,” Ayan Farah said in an interview with VOA''s Somali news service. "Our children lived in a beautiful life, with their mother and father and no problems. This is a new problem that we are facing. I don’t believe my children support those groups," Ayan Farah said. Six arrests Prosecutors said the six men, all between 19 and 21 years old, are friends and acquaintances. Four of them were arrested Sunday in Minnneapolis, while two others were arrested Sunday in San Diego.   Hodan Ali Omar echoed Ayan Farah''s doubts. She said the arrest of her brother Guled Oma, was “unjust and a set-up.” Omar said her brother is a student at Minneapolis Community and Technical College who performs his prayers and is “straight and never gets involved in gang and drug activities.” Asked if she was aware of his plans to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group, she said her brother is an adult and people like him travel. “I travel … my schoolmates travel. I never suspect that he wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS," she said, using another name for the Islamist group. The other three men arrested were identified as Abdirahman Daud, Hanad Musse and Zacharia Abdurahman, all from the Minneapolis area. Efforts to join IS U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger said the men worked for 10 months to leave the United States and join Islamic State.   The complaint said the men sought to travel to Turkey by way of New York City and San Diego, California, in an attempt to reach Syria. Ayan Farah said she and family moved to the United States to escape the insecurity of Somalia. But she said she feels U.S. law enforcement agencies are creating problems for her children and other young Somali-Americans. “To see our children being hunted here, and to use them against each other, to intimidate them and threaten and accuse them of working with those groups…I don’t believe they work with the groups.” Officials say more than 100 Americans are believed to have traveled to Syria, including more than dozen men and women from the Somali-American community in Minnesota. Minnesota’s Somali community previously grappled with the issue of young people joining terrorist groups between 2007 and 2010, when about two dozen men traveled to Somalia to join the al-Shabab militant group. At least two of them were involved in suicide missions in the country, while several of them were killed in battle.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 23:25:43 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/families-deny-somali-american-men-linked-to-islamic-state/2729719.html\n');

(550, '\nMorsi Sentence Raises Concerns About Egypt’s Future\n', '\nThe sentencing Tuesday of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, the country’s first democratically elected leader, has raised concerns about the stability of a nation beset by turmoil since a popular uprising nearly four years ago. An Egyptian court sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison in connection with the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012, but the ousted Islamist leader escaped a possible death sentence. The criminal court also found 12 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and supporters guilty of intimidation and violence, but not murder. "We are concerned by these sentences,” said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf.  “All Egyptians regardless of political affiliation are entitled to equal and fair treatment before the law, including the full respect for their right to due process.” She stopped short of suggesting the ruling was politically motivated and said the U.S. would comment further after reviewing the basis for the court’s decision. The Egyptian military, with Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi as army chief, toppled Morsi in 2013 after millions took to the streets to accuse his government of abusing its power. Since then, the government of now-President Sissi has jailed tens of thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters.  Hundreds have also been killed during protests. “It’s a very extreme kind of situation,” said Michele Dunne, Middle East analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “You have a military-led government that sees itself in an existential struggle for power with an Islamist movement that they have largely put into prison. It’s a very ugly struggle.” The potential for more instability will most likely grow as Egyptians face increased repression, a growing insurgency, a worsening economy and high unemployment, particularly among young people. Dunne said the only question is “the degree to which repression and human rights abuses are fueling radicalization and instability in the country.” Morsi’s prison sentence followed a string of mass death sentences that have sparked local and international condemnation.  It also came less than a month after the U.S. announced its decision to resume suspended military aid to Egypt, saying the move was in the interest of U.S. national security.   The aid was suspended after Morsi’s 2013 ouster by the military. Dunne said the U.S. should be careful about the public signal the decision to resume military aid may be sending.  “To the Egyptian public, the only signal can be one of endorsing a government that is carrying out very strong political oppression and human rights abuses," she said. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. has been “very clear” about the reason for the U.S. resumption of military assistance.  “That’s in our national security interest, and we can both do that and express concerns at the same time," she said.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 19:08:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/morsi-sentence-raises-concerns-egypt-future/2729635.html\n'),
(551, 'Iranian Anger Mounts Against Saudis', '\nAs a war of words heats up between Iran and Saudi Arabia over the civil war in Syria and sectarian violence in Yemen, there are signs that even secular Iranians are joining in the anti-Saudi chorus. Their wrath has been provoked by reports on social media of two Iranian boys being assaulted by Saudi security guards at the Jeddah airport while on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Iranians took to social media forums to denounce the Saudis after Iran’s foreign ministry briefed reporters about the incident. With national anger mounting, Iran suspended flights for pilgrims to Saudi Arabia in protest. The country’s “public honor has been tainted,” according to Iran’s minister of culture, Ali Jannati. The assault in late March was confirmed publicly by Iranian officials on April 6. Deputy Foreign Minister Hassan Ghashghavi said two Iranian teenagers who were “returning from umrah pilgrimage” were seized and forcibly made to undergo a body search by the guards. The minister claimed the assault was “similar to rape.” The Iranian social media campaign denouncing the Saudis has gone viral and appears to be resonating widely in Iran among secular as well as religious groups. It is heightening tensions between the two regional rivals, who are backing opposing sides in the strife in Yemen as well as the civil war in Syria, which seeks to unseat Tehran’s ally, President Bashar al-Assad. Iranian newspapers have devoted considerable space to the alleged rough handling of the teenagers, interviewing family members and quoting one of the fathers as saying, “This crime was not a crime against one person or a family, it was the crime of one government against another government.” Rhetoric Heating Up With national anger mounting, 70 Iranian lawmakers earlier this month demanded that the government suspend pilgrimage flights from Tehran until the safety of Iranian pilgrims can be guaranteed. Although the Saudis say they have arrested the guards involved, Iranians have organized loud protests outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Protesters include members of the government-sponsored student Basij organizations and, according to local reporters, ordinary Iranians as well. The students have been waving the yellow flag of Lebanon’s radical Shia movement, Hezbollah, and denouncing the Saudi-led airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Iranian Shia clerics, who have alleged in the past that Iranians are harassed when on pilgrimage to the mainly Sunni Gulf kingdom, have been quick to take offense over the incident with the teenagers and to stoke public anger. In a statement, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi said he was loath to advise Iranians to boycott the pilgrimage, but questioned, “Should we continue at any price?” He added, “They insult our clerics at the Prophet’s mosque and insult us at the airports. We should not be humiliated like this.” The incident is getting greater play, say analysts, because of the war of words both countries are ratcheting up over their regional rivalry. Officials in Tehran and Riyadh accuse each other of empire building and stirring up regional unrest between Sunni and Shia Muslims. The rhetorical war has become more venomous since the Saudis, with the support of Sunni Gulf neighbors, launched a military intervention last month in neighboring Yemen as Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, members of an offshoot Shia sect, threatened to capture the coastal port of Aden.    Tehran insists it is not playing a major role in Yemen, and accuses Riyadh of exaggerating its backing of the Houthis. But last week, U.S. State Department official Gerald Feierstein told lawmakers, “Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis. We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.” That also is the view of the Saudis. But the Iranians argue they are the wronged party. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been joining in the war of words, arguing that since the death of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah a younger generation in Riyadh is pulling the strings. Tweeting last week, he said, “Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us, but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power and replaced composure [with] barbarism.” Risk of Confrontation Some analysts say the Saudi intervention in Yemen has increased the risk of direct clashes erupting between the Saudis and Iranians.  Their rivalry until now has been fought through proxies. “The Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels,” warns analyst Alex Vatanka in a commentary piece for CNN. “Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen.” Some Iranian hawks have called on restive Shia Muslims in eastern Saudi Arabia to rebel against the ruling House of Saud. And on Sunday, the commander of Iran’s ground forces, Ahmad Reza Bordestan, warned the war in Yemen threatens to spill into neighboring Saudi Arabia unless Riyadh halts its military intervention. “There will be explosions in Saudi Arabia through rockets fired into its territory and the price of this [conflict] will be heavy for Saudi authorities,” Bordestan said in an interview with Iran’s state-owned Al-Alam TV. But Tuesday, Saudi Arabia said it is stopping airstrikes in Yemen, and the conflict there will enter a new phase, focusing on the political process and helping civilians. Iran calls the Saudi announcement a "step forward" towards a political settlement.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 18:46:11 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/iran-anger-mounts-against-saudis-/2729610.html\n'),

(553, '\nScientists Work to Develop Anti-Venom Against All Sub-Saharan Snakes\n', '\nThousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa die or are disabled each year due to poisonous snake bites.  Scientists in Britain are working to develop a serum that will counteract the venom from all sub-Saharan poisonous snake bites. The Puff adder is only one of many venomous snakes native to sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Robert Harrison, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says every year, puff adders and the other snakes kill about 32,000 people. “It''s not only that; other people who survive the bite - about 100,000 of them - are living with severe disabled limbs or legs, just really very disabling conditions,” he said. The current method of producing anti-venom - starting with the venom itself - is time-consuming and costly, and the serum must be refrigerated.  Victims have to be treated multiple times and there are possible side-effects.  With the price of about $140 per single dose, the full treatment may cost more than $500, which makes it unaffordable for most rural Africans.  In addition, because of the way they''re produced, current serums counteract poison from only one species, or a few related ones, so doctors must determine what snake bit the victim. The anti-venom developed by scientists at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine specifically for Nigeria, proved to be cheap, safe and effective. Harrison says his team is using it as a basis for developing universal anti-venom applicable to all venomous snakes in sub-Saharan Africa. “We''re going to do that by identifying the proteins that are unique to all the other species," he said. "And taking these unique proteins. i.e. different from the Source Scale Viper, the Puff Adder or the Spitting Cobra, and add that to the venoms of the original three.” For this purpose the lab is regularly extracting venom from 450 snakes belonging to 21 of the most deadly species of sub-Saharan African snakes. Scientists say the universal anti-venom will be more affordable than current serums and will be effective much longer. Target date for the ultimate test - after a year of storage at room temperature - is set for July 2018.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 17:00:37 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/scientists-work-to-develop-anti-venom-against-all-sub-saharan-snakes/2708922.html\n'),

(560, '\nProtesters Arrested Blocking Road to Giant Telescope Site\n', '\nScientists hoping to see 13 billion light years away, giving them a look into the early years of the universe, are facing opposition from Native Hawaiian groups who say the construction site of a new telescope is on sacred land. Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block the road leading to the summit of Mauana Kea on Hawaii''s Big Island. Officers with the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources arrested 11 protesters at the construction site on the summit. Native Hawaiians believe the site where the telescope is being assembled is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, said Kealoha Pisciotta, an opponent of the telescope project. "It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors," Pisciotta said. "It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god." All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, she said. While the Native Hawaiian groups opposing the project do not oppose the telescope itself, they disagree with the location of the construction on Mauna Kea, the highest point in the state. Scientists revere the site for another reason. They believe it''s an ideal location for one of the world''s largest telescopes because of the site''s remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. On Thursday, about 300 protesters, whom Pisciotta called "protectors," were on the mountain. Pisciotta wasn''t there, but she said she was in contact with the protesters. The people arrested Thursday were trying to block trucks heading to the peak, Pisciotta said. After the vehicles were allowed to pass, about 40 to 50 people began following the trucks, which moved slowly because of their heavy loads, she said. Work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit, Sandra Dawson, a spokeswoman for the project, said in an email to The Associated Press. Police said they warned protesters after an incident Monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested. Those arrested were released after they each posted $250 bail. "We regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site," Thirty Meter Telescope project manager Gary Sanders said in a statement. Opponents, who question whether land appraisals were done correctly, and whether Native Hawaiian groups had been consulted, have tried to prevent the construction of the $1.4 billion telescope. Protests also disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony last year, but no one was arrested. In fact, some protesters who yelled during the ceremony later apologized to event organizers and helped put away chairs, Pisciotta said. "We said aloha to each other, and we hugged," she said. University of Hawaii spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said in a telephone interview that the university is saddened about the arrests, but that access to site must be maintained. "If the university had a heart, it would be broken right now," he said about Thursday''s arrests. However, "we have to make sure the road is safe for whoever wants to be there." "The university sub-leases the land atop Mauna Kea for the telescope project, and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws, he said. Meisenzahl said he was not certain why the arrests were made. The observatory is expected to be operational by 2024, the same year a 39-meter telescope is expected to be completed in Chile.\n', 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 10:38:59 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-protesters-arrested-blocking-road-to-hawaii-telescope-site/2705522.html\n'),
(561, '\nHow Technology Eased Buhari''s Path to Power in Nigeria\n', '\nTechnology played a decisive role in helping Muhammadu Buhari become the first Nigerian to oust a sitting president at the ballot box, from social media campaigning to biometric machines preventing the widespread rigging that marred past polls. Three decades after seizing power in a military coup, part of the 72-year-old former general''s appeal to the electorate in Africa''s biggest economy lay in his successful rebranding as a man who embraced democracy. A good deal of that rebranding happened online, where campaigning from smartphones can build momentum at low cost. "The digital strategy has been a lifeline of the campaign for young people. We needed to create an image that enabled people to connect with him," Adebola Williams, the 29-year-old whose Lagos-based communications company, StateCraft, orchestrated Buhari''s digital drive, told Reuters. Even the doubters conceded that they had seen campaign material online. "There were a lot of discussions on their Facebook pages, but I am not sure that really influenced me," said Endurance Dauda, 24, a student in the northern city of Kaduna, who said many of her friends are not online. While not everyone was convinced the online methods swung their vote, the potential is hard to argue with. Africa''s most populous nation - with 170 million inhabitants - has some of the world''s highest levels of mobile phone ownership. There are 127 million mobile phone subscriptions in Nigeria, the International Telecommunications Union says. "In the last four years it has become a lot easier and cheaper to get the Internet on your phone. It isn''t exclusive anymore," Williams said, arguing that going online is no longer a luxury, despite most Nigerians living on less than $2 a day. Defeated president Goodluck Jonathan''s team also used social media, including YouTube videos highlighting Buhari''s autocratic past and facets of Jonathan''s life. In one, he was seen exercising with a personal trainer and playing squash. But possibly more significant than the online campaigning was the use of biometric machines to identify voters, which prevented the ballot-box stuffing and multiple voting that characterized past polls. "The card reader played a constructive role in deterring individuals who, in the past, have tampered with the electoral process either through ballot stuffing or tampering with the election results," said Dr. Christopher Fomunyoh, of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a non-governmental organisation that promotes democracy. As a result, this election was judged Nigeria''s freest and fairest election yet. "Fortune favors the bold. Deciding to go hi-tech was absolutely the right thing to do," U.S. Ambassador James Entwistle said after the poll. Once the biometric aspect of election technology had been proven, there was only way for the victor to celebrate. When Buhari got the call from Jonathan conceding defeat, Williams used his phone to capture the moment and share the image on Twitter and Instagram.\n', 'Thu, 02 Apr 2015 18:27:14 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/how-technology-eased-buhari-path-to-power-in-nigeria/2705050.html\n'),

(568, 'New US Sanctions Target Overseas Cyber Attackers', '\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday launched the first-ever sanctions program to financially punish individuals and groups outside the United States that are engaged in malicious cyber attacks. U.S. President Barack Obama, in an executive order, declared such activities a “national emergency” and allowed the U.S. Treasury to freeze the assets and bar other financial transactions of entities engaged in cyber attacks. Under the program, first reported by the Washington Post, cyber attackers or those who conduct commercial espionage in cyberspace can be listed on the official sanctions list of specially designated nationals, a deterrent long-sought by the cyber community. The move, which the paper said has been in development for two years, comes after a string of high-profile cyber attacks ranging from corporate hacks targeting Target, Home Depot and other retailers, to an attack on Sony and other data breaches. Commercial espionage Subjecting cyber criminals, companies that benefit from commercial espionage and even foreign intelligence operatives, to tough financial sanctions could have a “momentous” effect in deterring the growing number of cyber attacks seen daily on U.S. networks, said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer of Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm. “Today, the White House is making yet another huge leap forward in the effort to raise the cost to our cyber adversaries and establish a more effective deterrent framework to punish actors engaged in serious intentional destructive or disruptive attacks,” Alperovitch wrote in a blog posted on the company''s website. The executive order gives the administration the same sanctions tools it now deploys to address other threats - including crises in the Middle East and Russia''s aggression in Ukraine - and makes them available for less visible cyber threats. The program could prompt a strong reaction from China. Cybersecurity has been a significant irritant in U.S.-China ties, with U.S. investigators saying hackers backed by the Chinese government have been behind attacks on U.S. companies, and China rejecting the charges. Obama has moved cybersecurity toward the top of his 2015 agenda after recent breaches, and last month, the Central Intelligence Agency announced a major overhaul aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations.\n', 'Wed, 01 Apr 2015 10:21:02 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-us-sanctions-target-overseas-cyber-attackers/2702597.html\n'),

Jean Wiener was awarded a Goldman Environmental Foundation prize for his efforts to establish the Caribbean nation''s first Marine Protected Areas while working with local communities to promote sustainable fishing practices and preserve mangrove forests. In awarding the $175,000 prize, the Goldman foundation highlighted Wiener''s efforts in overcoming extreme poverty and political instability in Haiti, a country with few full-time environmentalists and almost no government programs to protect natural resources. Wiener, 50, is being honored along with five other prize winners at a ceremony in Washington on Wednesday for a campaign he led to create the Three Bays National Park, covering 75,000 square km (30,000 square miles) stretching from the city of Cap Haitien to the border with the Dominican Republic.

The Fort LibertDe bay had been targeted for port development by a U.S. government-backed project which was scrapped last year over environmental concerns and lack of investor interest. A schoolteacher in Port-au-Prince, Wiener studied biology at the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut. He is the founder of the Marine Biodiversity Protection Foundation (FoProBiM), Haiti''s only non-governmental environmental organization focusing on coastal and marine areas. Funded by the United Nations and the U.S. Agency for International Development, FoProBiM works with community groups to preserve natural resources, including fishing waters, endangered coral and mangroves which are cut down for charcoal. “It''s been over-fished to a point where the fishermen are catching almost nothing except juveniles,” Wiener said.

(575, 'Japanese Court Approves Restart of Reactors', '\nA Japanese court has approved the restart of Kyushu Electric Power''s Sendai nuclear power station, plaintiffs said on Wednesday, rejecting a legal bid to halt the process by residents worried about the safety of the plant. The decision by the Kagoshima District Court clears another hurdle for the plant to begin starting up as early as June as the government pushes to restart Japan''s idled nuclear industry four years after the Fukushima disaster. It also suggests another court ruling last week to prevent the operation of two reactors west of Tokyo may have been an aberration for Japan''s conservative judiciary, which anti-nuclear activists are petitioning to block restarts as a majority of the public remains opposed to atomic power. The Sendai reactors, on the coast of Kagoshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, are “very close” to getting final regulatory approval to being operations, an official from Japan''s nuclear regulator told Reuters earlier this month. Cleared regulatory hurdles Four years after a quake and tsunami wrecked the Fukushima Daiichi plant north of Tokyo, leading to meltdowns and mass evacuations, the Sendai reactors have cleared most regulatory hurdles and could begin starting up as early as June. A court order preventing Kyushu Electric from operating Sendai would have risked tying up the industry in legal battles for months or years. A spokeswoman at Kyushu Electric contacted by phone said the company could not immediately comment. Kyushu Electric shares rose after the decision and were 2.5 percent higher at 0134 GMT. Local residents who submitted a request to prevent the restart of the Sendai reactors argued the utility and regulator has underestimated the risk of nearby volcanoes and operational plans lack credible evacuation measures. Kyushu Electric denies this and the Nuclear Regulation Authority says it sees no need to change its rules, after last week''s ruling said the regulations “lack rationality.” The decision is a boost for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wants to reboot nuclear to help reduce high energy costs and reduce reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 01:03:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/japanese-court-approves-restart-of-reactors/2729750.html\n'),
(576, '\nScientists to Share Real-time Genetic Data on MERS, Ebola\n', '\nGenetic sequence data on two of the deadliest yet most poorly understood viruses are to be made available to researchers worldwide in real time as scientists seek to speed up understanding of Ebola and MERS infections. The project, led by British scientists with West African and Saudi Arabian collaboration, hopes to encourage laboratories around the world to use the live data - updated as new cases emerge - to find new ways to diagnose and treat the killer diseases, and ideally, ultimately, prevent them. "The collective expertise of the world''s infectious disease experts is more powerful than any single lab, and the best way of tapping into this ... is to make data freely available as soon as possible," said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity which is funding the work. The gene sequences, already available for MERS cases and soon to come in the case of Ebola, will be posted on the website virological.org for anyone to see, access and use. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral disease which first emerged in humans in 2012 and has been spreading in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries since then. It is caused by a coronavirus and has already killed more than 430 people. An unprecedented epidemic of Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 10,000 people in the past year and infected more than 25,000 mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Despite the many deaths caused by Ebola and MERS, researchers still know relatively little about the viruses - including what animals might be acting as "viral reservoirs" - and scientists are battling to develop safe and effective cures or vaccines against them. Genetic changes Paul Kellam, a professor at Britain''s Sanger Institute, said mapping the gene structure, or sequencing the genome, of a virus can tell scientists a lot about how it is spreading and changing, and help in the search for better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent infections. "With more genetic surveillance we can spot things that are potential areas of concern - such as [genetic] changes that might mean our diagnostics might not work so well any more, or changes that suggest a virus is becoming able to transmit more easily," he explained in a telephone interview. Yet while this kind of data is invaluable to researchers, it is rarely shared swiftly or freely enough among them. Saudi Arabia was widely criticized at the start of the MERS outbreak for being slow to cooperate with experts around the world wanting to conduct crucial research on the disease. Kellam said Saudi authorities are now committed to sharing viral data widely and immediately, keen to enlist the help of international scientists in controlling MERS. As part of the same gene sequencing project, Ian Goodfellow from the University of Cambridge is in Sierra Leone working with the government there to make similar data on the Ebola virus available on virological.org as soon as possible. He plans to collect samples from Ebola patients, sequence them in a matter of hours and process the data to make the viral genome sequences in weeks - a process that could take months if samples were to be bought back to Britain for analysis.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 13:38:05 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-scientists-to-share-real-time-genetic-data-on-mers-ebola/2729018.html\n'),

Unfortunately, many of them choose to deliver them in unorthodox ways, including from the air, as a recent incident clearly showed involving a gyrocopter landing on the Capitol’s West Lawn. When Florida Postal Service worker Doug Hughes landed his homemade gyrocopter on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol, in a daring bid to deliver a political message to the lawmakers, the security services were taken by surprise. He was quickly surrounded and taken away by police, his aircraft was checked for explosives, and now he faces several years of prison. But his stunt  highlighted once more that the airspace around most of the public buildings is easily penetrated by drones and light piloted aircraft, too small and flying too low to be safely prevented from reaching their goals. Difficult detection John Hansman a professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said small, flying vehicles are not easy to detect and stop. “If you have a very small target, like a gyrocopter, which doesn''t have a very large radar cross-section, so it''s not reflecting much energy back, and it''s close to the ground, you might get some signal coming there, but you may actually think it''s a building or a car moving on the ground, not a helicopter," he said. Hansman noted that heavy traffic in downtown Washington makes it even more difficult. “If you have a complex environment like an area around Washington where you have lots of other vehicles on the ground, you have vehicles in the air, and you have something very small like this, it''s actually not that difficult for it to slip through the protection,” said Hansman. Inadequate systems The chairman of the American Leadership and Policy Foundation, David Stuckenberg, is a former military pilot who writes about the airspace security. Speaking via Skype, he said the present safety systems are inadequate. “We need to understand that we''ve been lucky and as technology increases and as drones proliferate people will increasingly look at these as weapons of opportunity or technologies that can be adapted for ill intent,” he said. Stuckenberg said a lot more needs to be done before such systems are in place, such as conducting thorough analyses and bringing new regulations.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 13:14:17 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/keeping-washington-airspace-safe-is-tall-order/2728904.html\n'),

(579, 'Japan Mulls 2018 Moon Landing', '\nJapan''s space agency is considering an unmanned mission to the moon by 2018 or early 2019, part of an effort to beef up aerospace technology and keep pace with China and other emerging powers.   The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, included the possibility of a lunar landing in the fiscal year that begins April 1, 2018, in its summary of moon exploration plans by Japan and other countries.   Japanese media reported Tuesday that JAXA presented the proposal to a government panel of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology on Monday.   The agency still needs to win funding for the project. But it is raising hopes for a revival of space exploration. And the public broadcaster NHK showed satellite images of the Japanese islands, alit at night, and of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, as possible attractions for passengers of space flights.   Japan has long been one of the world''s leading space-faring nations and was the first Asian country, in 1970, to put a satellite into orbit around the Earth.   But in recent years the program has been crimped by a shoestring budget - unlike many space programs, it cannot rely on military budgets or projects to develop its rocket capabilities.   A mission to Mars in 1998 that was plagued by technical glitches failed and was finally abandoned in 2003.   China makes strides In the meantime, China has made big strides, putting astronauts into space as the third country to send a human into orbit after Russia and the United States. Japan''s space program has never attempted manned flight, though Japanese astronauts have been on the International Space Station.   JAXA has been reorganized and is seeking to expand its programs, teaming up with the Science and Technology Agency. The outline for international space exploration issued last week sets a goal for Japan to lead the U.S. and other countries in some areas in coming years.   Money has remained tight: the agency is expecting a total budget of 184 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in this fiscal year, slightly above last year''s 181.5 billion yen but on a par with its budget five years ago.     Still, the agency appears to be getting a boost from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s push to develop technologies with defense applications.   "There are areas of unlimited potential yet to be developed, and to boost controls of future threats it is important to minimize the power vacuum in space exploration,'''' the document says.   Power imbalance It forecasts increased competition for resources on the moon, and also risks from a possible "power imbalance'''' as Russia, China, India and other countries prepare for missions to the moon.   "A revival of competition and cooperation in moon exploration adds to the imperative for us to quickly achieve moon exploration,'''' it said, calling for consideration of an unmanned moon landing, among other goals.   The agency''s longer-term proposal includes several phases for moon exploration, including stationing robotic and remote-controlled probes to take measurements and study various aspects of the moon, such as energy, dust, seismology and topography. The final phase, from 2025 on, includes the possibility of manned visits to the moon, based on international cooperation.\n', 'Tue, 21 Apr 2015 08:46:04 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-japan-mulls-2018-moon--landing-/2728479.html\n'),
(580, 'Japan''s Maglev Train Breaks Own Speed Record', '\nA cutting-edge train in Japan has blown past its own world speed record, reaching 603 kph or 375 mph. Central Japan Railway Co. officials said the seven-car "maglev" train — short for "magnetic levitation" — traveled at more than 600 kilometers per hour for 11 seconds during a test run Tuesday. Its previous record, set in 2003, was 590 kph or 366 mph. The bullet train can reach such high speeds thanks to powerful magnets that allow it to hover several centimeters above the tracks, eliminating friction. The electronically charged magnets also help propel the train. Railway authorities said they hope the maglev technology can be used by 2045 to eventually cut the travel time in half, to just over an hour, between the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. A shorter route, between Tokyo and Nagoya, is expected to open sometime in the late 2020s. The goal is to cover the 300-kilometer distance in about 40 minutes, according to the Associated Press. Japan’s current shinkasen bullet-train service takes about 90 minutes for that distance.    Officials said Tuesday''s test was meant to determine the limits of the technology, but stressed they hope actual operating speeds eventually will be around 500 kph or 311 mph. The fastest commercial train now operating is China’s Shanghai maglev, which can reach 430 kph but averages 251 kph, according to Railway-Technology.com.

(583, 'Hippos Called River Life Force', '\nA new study says the hippopotamus is very important to the health of Africa’s rivers and lakes. That’s because hippos produce a key ingredient for aquatic life -- and a lot of it. But researchers warn that hippo populations are on the decline and that could damage ecosystems. The mighty hippopotamus is the third largest land mammal following the elephant and rhinoceros. Its name is derived from the ancient Greek for river horse. Hippos spend up to 16 hours a day in the water and venture on to land at night to feed. They eat tropical grasses, more than 200 kilograms per meal. And what goes in must come out. And there is the magic ingredient for Africa’s aquatic ecosystems – dung. Douglas McCauley and his colleagues decided to study it. “Well, we started looking at hippopotamus and realized that a big part of the story was their poop – was this vast amount of nutrients and energy that are moved across systems via their eating and their defecation,” he said. McCauley is an assistant professor of ecology, evolution and marine biology at the University of California Santa Barbara. He said hippos cross the boundaries of ecosystems. “Transiting between two different domains – between land, the terrestrial world, and then the aquatic world – means that there are also these important nutrient vectors. Because their eating lots and lots of stuff on land and then taking that all back to the place where they rest in the water -- in lakes and rivers -- and then basically dunging that all out. And it turns out when you start crunching the numbers to be a huge amount of material and energy and nutrients of this sort of natural fertilizer that is moved across these boundaries,” he said. So, each hippo contributes, if you will, over 60,000 kilograms of dung to African lakes and rivers every year. “It’s a big animal,” he said, “We’re talking about an animal that’s about 4,000 to 8,000 pounds. So, it’s got a big appetite. When you look across the entire continent and our estimate of how many hippos we now have in sub-Saharan Africa that comes out to millions of kilograms.” So, by now you understand it’s a tremendous amount of dung. But did you know that hippo dung looks like straw? “That’s right. So, they are mostly feeding on grass, sort of a straw-like grass. In fact, a lot of African grasses are used as straw and forage for cattle in places like America. So, they have these wonderfully well-developed lips that they use like a lawnmower to go across these short grass lawns that they actually manicure. And they keep them short because it seems to keep this resource accessible just to them,” said McCauley. McCauley said it’s even used as a communication device. “They actually use dung as a kind of signal amongst themselves. So, a male animal will dung at a sub-dominant male. They actually fling it back and forth with their paddle-like tail.” But the really important thing about hippo dung is its place in the food chain. “Well, there’s a lot of good stuff in dung. There’s a lot of nitrogen, carbon, even a bit of phosphorus. And some of these nutrients can be limiting in river systems. These are sort of the building blocks of life in some cases. So it really is injecting more of this food into these rivers. And a lot of the animals it seems in the rivers are quite happy to receive it. Some of them eat it up directly and some consumers, like fish, will eat insects that started their lives feeding on dung,” he said. McCauley actually described it as a life force in Africa’s rivers and lakes. But he said if the water flow is too low, the dung could overwhelm the ecosystem and be a pollutant. Too much water and its value is diluted. But as researchers learn more about the importance of hippos, there are fewer of them. “Hippos are declining across sub-Saharan Africa. In the past decade or so, we’ve seen about a 10 to 20 percent decline in their numbers. And beyond how many there are they’re in a lot fewer places. There are entire countries that have completely lost hippopotamus -- Egypt, for example. Hippos used to be an iconic god. It was the god of birth in Egypt. You see the hippo god. It’s a goddess turning up on amulets and wands and swords,” he said. McCauley said humans are responsible for most of the decline in the hippo population through hunting and habitat loss as human populations spread. “They have to have water. Well, guess what? Everybody else wants water. And it’s really unfortunate if you’ve tied your fate to water because when you compete with humans for water you often lose. So, people want water from rivers and lakes for building out cities – for helping to cool turbines– or damming rivers,” he said. It’s estimated hippos kill about 3,000 people a year. The animals may attack, for example, if people get too near a mother and calf. McCauley said careful thought must be given to the management of water, both for humans and wildlife. He says if managed intelligently, there should be plenty of water to go around, adding that the fates of humans, wildlife and ecosystems are closely tied together.

FireEye Inc, a U.S. security company, said the espionage effort took advantage of holes in Adobe Systems Inc.''s Flash software for viewing active content and Microsoft Corp.''s Windows operating system. The campaign has been tied by other firms to a serious breach at U.S. State Department computers. The same hackers are also believed to have broken into White House machines containing unclassified but sensitive information such as the president''s travel schedule. FireEye has been assisting the agencies probing those attacks, but it said it could not comment on whether the spies were the same ones who penetrated the White House because that information would be classified as secret. FireEye said that Adobe issued a fix for the security weakness Tuesday, so that users with the most current versions should be protected. A Microsoft spokesman said the company was working on a patch for its problem. In October, FireEye said the group it calls APT28 had been at work since 2007 and had targeted U.S. defense attaches and military contractors, NATO alliance offices, and government officials in Georgia and other countries of special interest to the Kremlin. Days before that report, security firm Trend Micro Inc. described a campaign it called "Pawn Storm'''' against computers in the State Department, Russian dissidents, NATO and other Eastern European nations.

India on Thursday proposed an amendment to the United Nations'' Montreal Protocol, which calls on countries to phase out their use of HFCs — gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners and insulating foams that are a highly potent form of greenhouse gas emissions. India''s amendment calls for a 15-year transition period for developing countries to phase down their use of HFCs in appliances. For years, India has opposed a phase-out of HFCs under the protocol, which focuses on curbing the use of ozone-depleting substances. It has argued HFCs should be handled instead under the Kyoto Protocol, which places the responsibility only on developed countries to make greenhouse gas cuts. Negotiations on a climate agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol have been more challenging, as countries disagree over how to share the burden of emissions cuts. Over 190 countries will meet in Paris later this year to try to secure a deal after more than two decades of talks. President Barack Obama and State Department climate change negotiators had long pressed India to agree to phase out HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, of which every country in the world is a member. Obama discussed phasing down HFCs with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a bilateral meeting in India in January. The United States had already secured cooperation in 2013 from China to phase out HFCs under the Montreal Protocol after years of opposition. Air-conditioner and refrigerator use has been projected to grow by up to 20 percent per year in India, according to the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency, an independent group. That puts India on track to surpass HFC consumption in the United States.

(588, '\nObama: Iran''s Recognition of Israel Not to Be Part of Nuclear Deal\n', '\nPresident Barack Obama has rejected a call by Israel that any final nuclear agreement with Iran include a "clear and unambiguous Iranian commitment of Israel''s right to exist." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had issued the demand Friday while strongly criticizing a framework nuclear deal reached by Iran and six world powers. President Obama discussed the issue during an interview Monday with the American news media organization NPR.  "The notion that we would condition Iran not getting nuclear weapons in a verifiable deal on Iran recognizing Israel is really akin to saying that we won''t sign a deal unless the nature of the Iranian regime completely transforms.  And that is, I think, a fundamental misjudgment," Obama said. "We want Iran not to have nuclear weapons precisely because we can''t bank on the nature of the regime changing. That''s exactly why we don''t want to have nuclear weapons. If suddenly Iran transformed itself to Germany or Sweden or France then there would be a different set of conversations about their nuclear infrastructure." Israel insists the framework nuclear agreement reached last week in Switzerland threatens its survival and Netanyahu has said he would press U.S. lawmakers not to give Tehran "a free path to the bomb." In appearances on U.S. television on Sunday, Netanyahu said he has discussed the issue with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress - nearly two thirds of House of Representatives members and a similar number in the U.S. Senate. President Obama says the framework nuclear deal reached with Iran was a "good deal" that was reached through "tough, principled diplomacy." Thursday''s framework deal between Iran and six world powers is aimed at providing relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbing Tehran''s nuclear program.  The agreement followed eight days of intensive talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, and sets the stage for a final agreement to be completed by June 30. Iran''s President Hassan Rouhani has vowed that Iran will honor all of its pledges in the agreement "as long as the other side honors its promises as well."  Under the deal, Iran''s breakout time, the minimum amount required to produce a nuclear bomb, will be extended "to at least one year, for a duration of 10 years," according to a U.S. fact sheet.  The breakout time is currently estimated to be two to three months. Tehran also agreed to reduce by about two-thirds the amount of its installed uranium enrichment centrifuges. "Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years," according to the fact sheet. The deal requires Iran to neutralize much of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium.  U.N. nuclear inspections will be boosted.  The Fordo underground nuclear facility will be converted so that it cannot enrich uranium.  Iran also agreed to redesign its Arak reactor to not produce weapons-grade plutonium. Iran has repeatedly said it is not interested in building a nuclear bomb, and the country''s Islamic leaders have issued rulings banning such weapons; but, the moves have not been able to persuade Western critics who say certain elements of Iran''s nuclear program have no clear non-weapons-related utility.\n', 'Tue, 07 Apr 2015 01:09:07 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/obama-iran-recognition-of-israel-not-part-of-nuclear-deal/2709414.html\n'),

The last Summit of the Americas, in Cartagena, Colombia in 2012, is remembered for a scandal involving U.S. Secret Service agents and prostitutes. This year’s main attraction will be Cuba. For the first time, a delegation from Havana will be at the table - something President Obama welcomes after his December announcement to end more than a half-century of isolation. “Our shift in policy toward Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in the Americas. This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas,” said Obama. It is by welcoming Cuba the U.S. hopes to renew its leadership role in Latin America - a role that has been waning due to what analysts say is U.S. economic weakness and the region’s increasing engagement with China and others.  U.S. isolation of communist Cuba has been an issue for Latin American governments for years.  At the Cartagena summit, hemispheric leaders protested Washington’s exclusion of Havana from the gatherings. Michael Shifter heads the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington.  He said the invitation of Cuba is a significant gesture. “It has enormous symbolism over the last 50 years as the country that has been isolated by the United States, squeezed by the United States, not treated as a sovereign nation. So for Latin Americans, that’s very, very important,” said Shifter. But opponents of the U.S. rapprochement call Cuba’s participation at the summit a setback for democratic ideals in the region - even in a grouping that includes imperfect democracies like Venezuela.   Frank Calzón of the Center for a Free Cuba in Washington said Cuba has not enacted democratic reforms and - unlike Venezuela - does not have an elected government.   “There is a difference between an imperfect democracy that violates human rights and a totalitarian regime that has laws that in fact deny, under their own law, human rights,” said Calzón. Cuba’s participation at the summit in Panama will be largely symbolic.  Washington still lists Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. Wayne Smith, a retired diplomat who once worked at what was the U.S. Embassy in Cuba and later at the U.S. Interests section, said that needs to change before Cuba can be a full participant. “They can come to the summit but if we reach agreements at the summit that all the other members would be a party to, I’m not sure where that would leave Cuba and the U.S. There might be agreements that might be reached that we couldn’t be parties to with the Cubans,” said Smith. President Obama wants Cuba off the terrorist list, but has yet to announce its removal.  Experts say having Cuba at the table in Panama is a big - if only symbolic - step in the long road to full normalization of ties.\n', 'Tue, 07 Apr 2015 00:59:36 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/with-cuba-at-summit-us-seeks-renewed-ties-with-latin-america/2709411.html\n'),

(594, 'California Shifts Water Use in Face of Drought', '\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown residents of the state must reduce their water consumption by 25 percent to cope with a major drought, and local communities are drawing up new restrictions.  Residents, businesses and water agencies are already making changes. This is the fourth year in a row of below average rainfall, which has created moderate to extreme drought conditions.  Bill McDonald of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California says new restrictions should save a precious resource that is drying up. “Right now, we rely on a lot of snow and rain, and that is not happening," said McDonald. Some of the state''s water comes from northern California and moves through aqueducts to the farm rich Central Valley and water-hungry cities in the south.   Farms uses 80 percent of the state''s water to produce much of the nation''s fruit, vegetables and nuts.  Farming is largely exempt from the new restrictions, but many farms have seen their water allocations cut to zero.   They use groundwater for crops, and new rules for pumping it may help preserve the water table, which is being depleted quickly in some places. Analyst Caitrin Chappelle of the Public Policy Institute of California says the public wants stronger conservation measures. “Our recent survey asked the question, do you think local and state government is doing enough about the drought.  And we saw the majority said no," said Chappelle. Among new rules already in place, restaurants will face fines if they offer water to customers who have not asked for it.  At a Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles, owner Gilberto Cetina says the rule will save more than just drinking water. “It is the water, it is the ice, the electricity you use to make the ice, the cut when you give the water, or if you use glasses, the water you use to wash the glass," said Cetina. Californians say they want to help. “We can just do what we can, turn off the water in between brushing our teeth," said one. Major water users, such as golf courses, will face new restrictions, and local communities are drawing up rules to meet the target of a 25 percent reduction by next year. Some homeowners are being paid to tear out grass and to landscape with drought-tolerant native plants.   Bill McDonald says more homeowners are installing efficient drip irrigation systems. “And that is the future.  That is where we are going, because putting drinking water on a landscape that is ornamental is not a good use of resources," he said. Other new restrictions will be coming for businesses and public agencies, as well as to residents.  Restaurateur Gilberto Cetina says he is doing his part, and has already tried charging his customers for water. “I got 10 customers mad and I stopped it.  But I think we can do it now.  I think now is the right time to do it," he said. Analysts say there is no single solution to California''s water shortage, but education, better planning and conservation will help the state get through its periodic droughts.   They say long-term solutions include recycling waste water and strengthening the distribution system, using pricing to encourage more efficient water use and using technology to reduce waste.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 18:26:00 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/california-shifts-water-use-in-face-of-drought/2709271.html\n'),

(599, '\nUS Demographic Shift Will Have Huge Political Impact\n', '\nIn less than 30 years, whites will no longer be the racial majority in the United States.  Hispanics, African Americans and Asians – the country’s three largest minority groups – will outnumber whites.  As VOA Senior Analyst Victor Morales explains in this second part of a two-part series, this shift will have important implications for the nation’s politics. You can read part one here. At the turn of the 20th century, political parties in the United States were strong institutions that mobilized immigrant groups around core issues.  The political machines of both major parties – the Democrats and the Republicans – made sure that voters turned out on Election Day.  Sometimes party workers even took immigrants to the polls and, on occasion, illegally paid them to vote.  But with the rise of mass communications – radio, television and the Internet – candidates themselves have been able to reach out to voters directly, weakening the role of parties in the United States.  As this trend continues, analysts say, minorities increasingly will need to be self-motivated to cast their ballots.  “Democrats are not going to be able to continue to rely on the votes of African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans without being more explicit in their voter outreach and, more importantly, in their issue outreach in terms of their advocacy of the issues that matter to African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans,” said University of California, Berkeley political scientist Taeku Lee. Lee, an expert on racial and ethnic politics and political participation in the United States, said candidates of both parties should not be complacent when it comes to winning minority votes.  “Even though Latinos and Asian Americans are quite likely to be very religious, and those religious values and their social conservatism that attaches to that are really important to them, it doesn’t quite connect to politics in the same way that it does for the traditional white Republican base, for whom a high level of religiosity and social conservativism in some ways become the defining issue of their politics,” said Lee.  “So I think bread and butter issues matter quite a lot.  And when forced to choose between bread and butter issues like immigration policy, education reform, healthcare reform and social conservatism, Latinos and Asian Americans are going to pick the party that advances those bread and butter issues.” Many analysts say that the expansion of government social welfare programs tied to these issues will shape U.S. politics in the long term.  “The political center of the country is driven not by ethnicity, but it’s driven by benefits,” said American Enterprise Institute political scientist Charles Murray, who noted that America’s changing demographics will likely play a subordinate role to more general trends in national politics. “Even people who vote Republican who are receiving Medicare and Social Security are going to be reluctant to vote for Republican candidates who threaten those programs in any way,” said Murray.  “That’s equally true of people who receive major benefits from Welfare and Medicaid.  “So I see the political center constantly moving leftward – with the Republican center moving leftward along with the Democrats.  Republicans don’t have to sit down and have strategy meetings about that.  I think political survival will just drive them that way.  If I were a liberal Democrat, I would be looking with great complacency on the prospects for the next 30 or 40 years,” he said. Despite a significant rise in minority Democratic voters in recent decades, many analysts expect Hispanics, Asians and African Americans to vote increasingly along economic lines.  As more minority voters enter the nation’s middle and upper classes, they say the Republican Party will have an opportunity to replenish its base of largely aging white voters, particularly if the GOP can effectively address illegal immigration – a key gateway issue for Hispanics. “It’s better for minorities when the two parties are competing for them,” said Tamar Jacoby, president and CEO of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small business owners working to promote better immigration laws.  “The worst situation is what was true for African Americans for years, when Republicans ignored them and Democrats took them for granted.”  That, analysts say, is a mistake that politicians of both parties cannot afford to repeat with the nation’s burgeoning majority minority.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 14:53:18 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/us-demographic-shift-will-have-huge-political-impact/2708774.html\n'),

(604, '\nUS Man Charged With Killing 3 Muslims Faces Death Penalty Hearing\n', '\nThe man accused of killing three North Carolina college students - their family says because they were Muslim - is scheduled to appear in court for a hearing to determine whether he could face the death penalty. Prosecutor Roger Echols said in court documents last month he plans to seek the death sentence if Craig Stephen Hick, 46, is convicted of first-degree murder. Hicks is charged with the February 10 killings of 23-year-old Deah Shaddy Barakat, his wife - 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and her sister - 19-year-old Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. Police say he appears to have been motivated by a long-running dispute over parking spaces at a condominium complex. The victims'' families are adamant that they were targeted because they were Muslims and have pushed for hate-crime charges. The FBI is conducting what it has called a “parallel preliminary inquiry” to the homicide investigation to determine whether any federal laws were violated, including hate crime statutes. Search warrants filed by police said Barakat was shot in the head near the entrance to his condo. The two women were found in or near the kitchen. Eight spent shell casings were found at the crime scene, investigators said. Earlier search warrants listed a dozen firearms recovered from the condo unit Hicks shared with his wife, in addition to the handgun the suspect had with him when he turned himself in after the shootings. Hicks, who was unemployed and studying to become a paralegal, posted online that he was an atheist and a staunch advocate of the constitutional right to bear arms. Neighbors described him as an angry man who had frequent confrontations over parking or loud music, sometimes with a gun holstered at his hip.

(605, '\nAccused Boston Bomber Followed Brother''s Lead, Defense Argues\n', '\nAccused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev followed his older brother''s lead in carrying out the 2013 bombing that killed three people, rather than acting on his own motivation, one of his attorneys argued on Monday. Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of carrying out the April 15, 2013, attack and fatally shooting a police officer three days later as he and his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, tried to flee the city. Following the prosecution''s closing argument, that the ethnic Chechen defendant was an extremist who had "wanted to punish America" with the bombing attack, Tsarnaev''s lawyers argued that he had been in the thrall of his older brother. Defense attorney Judith Clarke, who opened the trial last month by admitting that her client had committed all the crimes of which he is accused, repeated that assertion on Monday. "There is no excuse. No one is trying to make one. Planting bombs at the Boston Marathon one year and 51 weeks ago was a senseless act," Clarke said. But in a counterpoint to the blunt "it was him" admission of her opening statement, Clarke told the jury that Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police, had planned the attack and built the bombs. "Tamerlan did that," she said. "We need to understand who was leading and who was following." By shifting some of the blame to the older brother, Tsarnaev''s lawyers are trying to persuade the jury, if they find the defendant guilty, to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death. The jury on Monday also viewed video of Tsarnaev standing with a backpack in the crowd at the marathon''s finish line minutes before the blasts that killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Tsarnaev is also accused of the fatal shooting of Massachusetts of Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26. ''Wanted to Punish America'' Prosecutors argued that the younger Tsarnaev shared his brother''s violent ideology. "The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors," Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. "He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people." Chakravarty noted that evidence showed that Tsarnaev, who moved to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack, had copies of al-Qaida''s "Inspire" magazine on his computers. "These were political choices," he said of Tsarnaev''s actions. "He was making a statement, ''an eye for an eye.''" Hours after the gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar sped off in a car, running his brother over in the process, the defendant hid in a boat parked in a backyard. While there, he wrote a note suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. Monday''s closing statements could be a preview of the arguments each side plans to make during the next phase of the trial, when the same jury will hear a fresh round of witness testimony before determining whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison without possibility of parole, or to death. Richard''s parents, William and Denise; dancer Heather Abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments. The defendant sat quietly in court on Monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie. He did not speak. The surveillance video viewed by the jury on Monday shows a bomb, which the defendant is charged with leaving in front of the Forum restaurant near the finish line, going off with a blinding flash, killing Richard and Lu. The jury also saw video taken by a man injured in the blast. The graphic video captures the chaos of the immediate aftermath, with one responder yelling that he was worried about the possibility of an additional blast and another voice screaming, "We''re on fire here.

(606, 'Obama: Iran Deal ‘Once-in-a-Lifetime’ Chance', '\nPresident Barack Obama said the framework nuclear agreement reached last week with Iran represents a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to bring some stability to the Middle East - stability which would be good for Israel as well as other nations.  However, some members of the U.S. Congress remain unconvinced and a key U.S. lawmaker plans to go ahead with legislation requiring Obama to submit any final agreement to Congress for debate and a vote. Speaking to The New York Times Sunday, Obama said he would consider it a fundamental failure of his presidency, if, on his watch or as a consequence of work that he has done, Israel was rendered more vulnerable. He said that would be not just a strategic failure, but a moral failure. Message to Israeli people Asked what his message is to the Israeli people about the agreement, the president said that while they have a right to be concerned about Iran, they should be equally concerned Iran is not able to acquire nuclear weapons. He said there is no better option to ensure that doesn’t happen than the framework agreement reached in Switzerland. The framework is an outline to be used during subsequent negotiations on a final agreement by the end of June. “Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch,” Obama said. But he also expressed hope this diplomatic arrangement can “usher in a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations” and a new era in Tehran’s relations with its neighbors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on U.S. television Sunday, called the framework agreement a “bad deal” that gives Iran “a free path to the bomb.” “It leaves the pre-eminent terrorist state of our time with a vast nuclear infrastructure. Remember, not one centrifuge is destroyed. Thousands of centrifuges will be left spinning uranium. Not a single [nuclear] facility, including underground facilities, is being shut down. "This is a deal that leaves Iran the capacity to produce the material for many, many nuclear bombs. It does so by lifting the sanctions pretty much upfront. So, Iran will have billions of dollars flowing into its coffers not for schools, or hospitals, or roads, but to pump up its worldwide terror machine and its military machine, which is busy conquering the Middle East, as we speak,” Netanyahu said. He said this is not a partisan issue, or just an Israeli issue, it is a world issue because everyone will be threatened by nuclear-armed Iran. Stringent restrictions U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who took part in the negotiations, said the agreement will give the international community “almost instantaneous” recognition of any attempt by Iran to evade the deal. Moniz called it a long-term arrangement. “There is no sunset. There will be a lot of phases starting with extremely stringent restrictions on Iran’s program. Hopefully, they will comply for a long time, build up confidence. But, we have 10-year restrictions, 15-year restrictions, 25-year restrictions, and we have forever-restrictions. So, this is a long-term program, not something that will go away in a few years,” he said. Moniz said the agreement calls for unprecedented access to Iran’s nuclear program, not just declared sites, but to any covert aspects of their infrastructure. Many unkowns The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tennessee’s Bob Corker, said many details of the agreement are not yet known, making it difficult to determine if this is a good or bad agreement. He said there appear to be discrepancies on how sanctions will be relieved. He also wants to know how snap inspections will be conducted on covert aspects of Iran’s nuclear program, as well as its military dimensions. “Again, I’m open. I know there will be a lot of details worked out over the next several months. That’s why, on behalf of the American people, Congress needs to be playing a role. What the American people may not know right now is that there will be all kinds of classified annexes that are very important. "They lay out the details as to how much of this is going to take place. And, that’s why it’s so important that Congress play its rightful role in approving this prior to the congressionally-mandated sanctions that we put in place are alleviated,” said Corker. Corker said his committee will go ahead with plans to vote April 14 on legislation requiring the president to submit a final agreement to Congress for debate and a vote. It would prohibit Obama from suspending sanctions during a 60-day congressional review. However, he acknowledged he is uncertain if he has the required 67 votes in the 100-seat chamber to override a presidential veto.\n', 'Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:01:24 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/obama-iran-nuclear-agreement-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity/2708079.html\n');

(607, '\nBoston Marathon Bombing Victims Describe Injuries, Loss at Trial\n', '\nThe long-lasting impact of the Boston Marathon bombing was brought home to jurors as the loved ones of two of the people killed in the attack described their profound loss. The testimony came on Wednesday, the second day of the penalty phase in the trial of convicted bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The jury first heard from the family of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, who was shot and killed by Tsarnaev and his brother as they tried to flee days after the bombings. Joseph Reynolds, Collier''s stepfather, said his wife could not get out of bed for months after her son''s death and has still been unable to return to work, two years later. ''Cop at an early age'' Reynolds and Collier''s brother, Andrew, described Sean Collier as a kid who always had a strong sense of right and wrong, even putting bugs outside rather than killing them. "He was a cop at an early age," Reynolds said. Three people were killed and more than 260 wounded when Tsaranev and his brother, Tamerlan, detonated two pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon''s finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted earlier this month in the bombings and in Collier''s killing. Tsarnaev''s lawyers say Tamerlan masterminded the bombing and recruited his impressionable younger brother, then 19. They contend that Dzhokhar does not deserve the death penalty. But prosecutors have called a long list of victims to argue that he deserves the death penalty for his crimes. The same jury that convicted Tsarnaev will decide his punishment. Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old Boston University graduate student from China who was killed in the bombing, was remembered as a highly intelligent, vivacious young woman who took pleasure in even the smallest things, especially food. "Everything you cook for her, she say, `It''s so good. It''s awesome,'' " said Jinyan Zhao, a surrogate aunt to Lu. She called Lu "a beautiful nerd." Jurors also watched a video of a eulogy her father gave at a memorial service at BU. In it, Lu''s father calls her "the family''s Shirley Temple" and "the little elf and jolly little girl" who brought everyone in the family "ceaseless laughter, lightheartedness and fun." Inflammatory photograph Tsarnaev''s lawyers on Wednesday tried to blunt the impact of a photo of Tsarnaev giving the finger to a security camera in his jail cell three months after the bombing. His lawyers showed the jury video clips of him looking into the camera, apparently fixing his hair in the reflective glass, and then making a slightly angled, two-finger gesture similar to what teenagers often do playfully in selfies. Then he raised his middle finger at the camera. In an apparent attempt to press the argument that Tsarnaev was a "kid" who was led astray by his big brother, defense attorney Miriam Conrad asked Assistant U.S. Marshal Gary Oliveira if he knew how old Tsarnaev was at that time. The witness said he didn''t. "You don''t know that he was 19 years old?" Conrad asked.

(613, '\nBaltimore Residents Demand Answers After Detainee''s Death\n', '\nOn the spot where Baltimore police took Freddie Gray into custody April 12, puddles of melted candle wax have hardened around liquor bottles left in tribute. In quick succession on that Sunday, Gray made eye contact with a police officer, ran away, was caught with a switchblade on his hip, and was dragged into a police van. He died a week later from what a family attorney says was an internally severed spinal cord. "All they said was, he looked at us, and ran, and then we chased. That doesn''t meet any legal standard for stopping or arresting somebody," said Judge William Murphy, Jr., a lawyer representing Gray''s family. "The only thing this kid did wrong by running from the police, was that he didn''t run fast enough." Suspended, with pay Six police officers in the eastern U.S. state of Maryland are on paid leave as investigators look into what killed the 25-year-old after he was taken into police custody. Residents in the Sandtown neighborhood, where Gray was arrested, told VOA they want answers for what they say is a longstanding face-off between police and the black community. Melissa lives in Sandtown. She says the shine on police badges wore off long ago for her. The unsolved stabbing death of her cousin last year only makes it worse. "They’ve been given badges to be bullies, they’ve been given badges to terrorize," she said, standing in front of the memorial to Gray. There is no justice, Melissa believes, even in the decision to place the officers on leave. "Suspended with pay? What is that? You giving them a paid vacation for killing somebody?" Shawn, a Sandtown resident who also passed by the memorial on Wednesday, said he grew up fearing police. “This is the reason why we run - because we already know, there’s a 90 percent chance that if you don’t run, you’re going to get locked up for something," he said. “It’s sad that we had to take this death, to make publicity for this when we’ve been talking about this for years," Shawn added. More answers The Baltimore Police Department has promised more answers by next week. A second person in the police van that morning is being treated as a witness, according to an agency statement on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Justice announced this week it also would review the case, which follows a string of high-profile police involved killings that have raised allegations of abuses against minorities around the country. Baltimore residents have held several rallies since Gray''s death, and plan to continue protests through the end of the week. "We can''t bring Freddie back," Murphy, the family''s attorney, told VOA. "But we can use this tragedy as an opportunity and as a stimulus to doing the right thing. Although that wouldn''t be a fair exchange for a human life, it would mean that he didn''t die in vain."\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 22:59:39 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/baltimore-residents-demand-answers-after-detainees-death/2731190.html\n'),

The Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act 99 to 0. It would impose large fines on people convicted of trafficking and sex crimes against children. The money would be used to help the victims recover. Texas Republican John Cornyn is the bill''s leading sponsor. "We have not fallen deaf to the cries of those who actually need our help... this legislation will be instrumental in helping victims of sexual abuse and trafficking recover from a life in bondage." The bill had been stalled over anti-abortion language that Democrats did not like. The abortion provision was stripped from the bill after a compromise. Senate Republicans had been refusing to allow a confirmation vote on President Barack Obama''s choice for the next attorney general, Loretta Lynch, until the trafficking bill was passed. Obama nominated Lynch in November to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. A vote on Lynch is now scheduled for Thursday. She is expected to have enough votes to win confirmation.

She was 92.   Keefe died Tuesday in Connecticut, after a brief illness, said her daughter, Mary Ellen Keefe.   Keefe grew up in Vermont, where she met Rockwell and posed for his painting when she was a 19-year-old telephone operator. The painting was on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on May 29, 1943.   Although Keefe was petite, Rockwell''s Rosie the Riveter had large arms, hands and shoulders. The painting shows the red-haired Rosie in blue jean work overalls sitting down, with a sandwich in her left hand, her right arm atop a lunchbox with the name "Rosie" on it, a rivet gun on her lap and her feet resting on a copy of Adolf Hitler''s manifesto "Mein Kampf." The entire background is a waving American flag.   Rockwell wanted Rosie to show strength and modeled her body on Michelangelo''s Isaiah, which is on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.   Keefe, who never riveted herself, was paid $5 for each of two mornings she posed for Rockwell and his photographer, Gene Pelham, whose pictures Rockwell used when he painted.   "You sit there and he takes all these pictures," Keefe told The Associated Press in 2002. "They called me again to come back because he wanted me in a blue shirt and asked if I could wear penny loafers."   Twenty-four years after she posed, Rockwell sent her a letter calling her the most beautiful woman he''d ever seen and apologizing for the hefty body in the painting.   "I did have to make you into a sort of a giant," he wrote.   The Rosie painting - not to be confused with a poster by a Pittsburgh artist depicting a woman flexing her arm under the words "We Can Do It" - would later be used in a nationwide effort to sell war bonds.   The painting is now part of the permanent collection at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 19:15:03 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-model-for-norman-rockwell-painting-rosie-the-riveter-dies/2731054.html\n'),
(619, '\nCarter: Europe''s Security Challenges Should Mean More Defense Spending\n', '\nEurope should be spending more on its military given the security challenges facing the region, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday, adding that falling investment had eroded Europe''s ability to be a capable U.S. ally. "They''re not doing enough. They are spending a smaller share of their GDP than they have in the past, [than] we do now and [than] many, like Russia, are spending. It''s too low," Carter told a group of university students training as military officers. The Pentagon chief made the remarks after being asked by one student what the United States could do to encourage Europe to be more financially committed to its own defense. Low European military spending has long been a sore point for the United States. U.S. presidents and defense secretaries regularly urge the allies to stop the slide in spending. The NATO air campaign that led to the ouster of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 exposed a number of weaknesses among alliance militaries, such as a lack of reconnaissance aircraft and of specialists needed to identify bombing targets. At a summit last year in Wales, the 28 NATO partners renewed their commitment to the goal of each country spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. But only four countries - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States - were meeting the target in the 2013-14 time frame, according to a NATO report in January. Turkey, France and Poland were just shy of the goal over the same period. Carter said Russian aggression in Ukraine, the refugee problem in northern Africa and the mass killing at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris were wake-up calls about the need to boost security. "I think when the Cold War ended a lot of Europe figured that its security problems had ended. And now they''re beginning to wake up," he said. "You have Turkey, a NATO ally, right there on the front lines with Syria and Iraq and the fight against ISIL," Carter added, using an acronym for Islamic State militants. Carter acknowledged Europe had been slower to recover from the financial crisis than the United States, but he insisted Europe still had the means to reach the 2 percent commitment. "It has to have the military power to be a capable ally of ours and we see that slipping," he said. "That''s got to turn around."\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 19:09:22 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/reu-pentagon-chief-carter-europe-security-defense-spending/2731090.html\n'),
(620, '\nNew Report Urges Overhaul of US Govt. International Broadcasting\n', '\nA new study in the United States says the government should overhaul its international broadcasting operations so that they support U.S. foreign policy objectives and strategic American interests. The report released Wednesday was written mostly by former officials of the government''s Broadcasting Board of Governors and one of its divisions, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty -- a news operation whose broadcasts once were aimed at people living in communist countries during the height of the Cold War. The BBG oversees Voice of America, whose website, radio and television broadcasts and mobile platforms reach 164 million people around the world each week in 45 languages. The report concludes that the U.S. government''s current broadcasting "mission is unclear, its attachment to U.S. foreign policy strategies tenuous at best, and its organizational structure ineffective." It said foreign governments "with anti-U.S. messaging are fomenting an information war, and winning" against American interests. The report called for a revamped Voice of America operation, one in which "America should be shown in all its complexity, nuance and diversity." Yet the report said "detractors should be denied an opportunity to tarnish America." The latest report, presented at a forum staged by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is part of an ongoing debate in Washington on what role the government''s international broadcasting operations ought to play. Legislation calling for an overhaul to "promote" U.S. foreign policy passed the House of Representatives last year, but died in the Senate. New legislative proposals are likely again this year. In response to the new report, the BBG''s interim CEO and director, André Mendes, said, "While we respect the intent of the report’s authors and distinguished interview subjects, we see a disconnect between the external perceptions of the BBG and the actual measures and demonstrable impact of our networks." Mendes said the report contains many well-known criticisms of the agency. But he said, "We see evidence of the effectiveness of our programs from our audiences around the world, from 2,500 on-the-ground media partners, and from professional research and other credible measurements of audience engagement."\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:59:41 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/new-report-calls-for-overhaul-of-us-government-international-broadcasting-operations/2731101.html\n'),

(622, 'US Enrollment in Korean Language Classes Growing', '\nKorean language study is quickly growing in popularity across the United States.  The Modern Language Association finds that college enrollments in Korean increased by almost 45 percent between 2009 and 2013.  This is happening at a time when total language enrollments have fallen.   Fans call Korean popular music K-pop.  It has attracted fans from around the world.  It has caught on thanks to the Internet and websites like YouTube, which carry South Korean pop music and dramas.    The growing popularity of this entertainment is called the "Korean wave.” "As a dean of Humanities, to look at a country that’s creating its reputation globally through cultural production, that’s very exciting," said David Schaberg,  Dean of the Division of Humanities at University of California Los Angeles. "Or course it attracts students. Of course it means more Americans who may have had nothing at all to do with Korea will now be gravitating to the study of Korean language and culture," he said. Korean entertainment is one reason why enrollments in Korean language classes have increased by almost 45 percent in four years.  The Modern Language Association’s Rosemary Feal says that it is the biggest increase for any language enrollment at the university level.   “Many students say they really want to get inside the culture and they want a better understanding and so clearly language gives us access to culture and cultural expression," said Feal. That’s the case for Korean language student, Persida Radu. “I actually first got into Korean pop and then the dramas they show and then learning it," said Radu. Feal says another reason for the enrollment increase is that children of Korean immigrants want to learn the language of their ancestral homeland. “We know there is a correlation between the immigration patterns and the new generations wanting to learn a family language," she said. This is true of John Park, who is taking a class for heritage speakers at UCLA. “I don’t speak Korean too well, and of course I want to communicate with my parents, [and] grandparents,  and so I took it to learn how to read and write more effectively," he said. UCLA Korean professor Sung-Ock Sohn says South Korea''s global economic clout is yet another reason why more students want to learn Korean.    “Now in this global world, Korean brands such as Hyundai, Samsung, LG, it’s [they’re] very well known, well recognized by everyone. So students I think [if] they know the Korean language and proficiency in Korean really gives huge opportunity in job positions for American students who speak the Korean language," said Sohn. UCLA’s David Schaberg says this trend is also affecting American culture. “What we’re seeing is really the practical infinitesimal change of culture as American culture becomes more Asian, or at least opens itself to more Asian influences," he said. Language researchers say the trend of growing enrollment in Korean language classes shows no sign of ending soon, especially as the popularity of K-pop continues and second and third generation Koreans seek to re-connect with their heritage.\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:30:09 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/enrollment-in-korean-language-classes-growing/2731075.html\n'),
(623, '\nUS-Cuba Relations Challenge Ballplayers Choosing Pro Path\n', '\nYasmany Tomas had three choices to continue his baseball career: stay in Cuba and make up to $2,500 a month, play in Japan with a shot at a million dollar contract, or give up family and life in the island on hopes of hitting the jackpot in the major leagues. The 24-year-old Cuban slugger opted for life in the U.S., and all the changes that come with it, signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks for $68.5 million for six seasons. While travel and business restrictions between the United States and Cuba are being eased, it''s not clear when Tomas will see his family again. It could be years before they''re together once more, whether in the states or on the communist island, as he''s given up his right to return to his former life. Amid dual pressures of pro sports and being in a foreign country away from family for the first time, Tomas and dozens of players navigate those choices and life changes with their families through uncharted political waters, as the U.S. and Cuba began 2015 with steps to improve rocky relations. “I would love to be there in the stands when he starts to play, to give him the support we''ve always given him,” said Tomas'' mother, Melba Rosa Bacallao, holding back tears as she sifted through an album with pictures of her son from her two-bedroom house in Havana. “He always tells me that his daughter and we are his priorities, that he wants to get ahead in life for us.” Complicated landscape Optimism in both countries and demand from U.S. teams are clearly growing despite the complicated landscape. The governments have made few tangible policy changes that significantly impact players, their relatives and the game. Baseball is treading carefully, not wanting to step on diplomatic toes. There were 74 Cubans on major or minor league rosters on opening day, 11 more than last year and more than double the 29 in 2008. Most developed in state-run academies where kids breathe baseball from an early age. Baseball''s lure has rippled through Cuba, where attitudes toward the U.S. have softened in the last few years as the island adapts to social, political and economic changes. President Barack Obama met recently with Cuban President Raul Castro, and the island will be taken off the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Players in Cuba talk openly about wanting to play in the United States, commenting in ways that used to be considered sinful by authorities who severely punished big league dreams. Officials have also discussed playing spring training games on the island, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. And through deals in other countries not limited by the U.S. embargo, Cuba has shown signs it is willing to let players enter baseball''s free market. “Of course I would like to play where they play the best baseball in the world,” Yulieski Gourriel, star infielder for the national team, said during the Caribbean Series in Puerto Rico in February. “As long as we have authorization, we''ll always want to do so.” Gourriel made $1 million in Japan last season, then returned to his pro team in Havana. After accounting for Japanese taxes, he paid 10 percent to Cuba''s baseball federation (which acted as his agent), taking home enough to be rich in a communist country with limited options for spending and investment. Leaving isn''t always as difficult and dramatic as it used to be. Teen sensation Yoan Moncada, who in March agreed to a record $31.5 million signing bonus with the Boston Red Sox, left Cuba last year thanks to 2013 laws that allow citizens to travel abroad without an exit visa. No midnight speedboat to Mexico, no shady smugglers. He asked for and was granted release, established residency in Guatemala, then worked out for MLB clubs. Ballplayers released by the federation can travel elsewhere legally, said Antonio Diaz, a spokesman for Cuba''s baseball federation. Moncada “was discharged because he was of no interest to the national team,” he said. But, in accordance with the embargo, those hoping to play in the U.S. must sign an affidavit that says they won''t return to Cuba. Little face-to-face with family Face-to-face contact with family becomes tough. Cuban law allows defectors to revisit eight years after departing, which former MLB players Jose Contreras and Rey Ordonez utilized two years ago. But U.S. immigration and strict tourist regulations regarding Cuba haven''t changed. “It''s very difficult. It takes a lot of time to get a visa for your family in Cuba,” said Seattle Mariners pitcher Roenis Elias, who fled Cuba in 2010. Changes in Cuba-U.S. policy since December have come mainly from the American side and aren''t specific to baseball. In January, the U.S. quadrupled the amount U.S. residents could send to Cubans to $2,000 per quarter. It also eased travel restrictions for Americans and loosened controls on U.S. businesses to spur the island''s small private sector. Netflix, MasterCard and online home rental service Airbnb have entered the Cuban market, though few on the island have high-speed Internet and most credit card issuers prohibit transactions from the country. No MLB on-demand yet. “Everybody is kind of figuring it out as we go, taking our lead from the diplomatic talks,” Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi said. “That''s the optimistic view, that there''ll be greater openness.” Teams aren''t shy to spend huge amounts to snatch up the next big-league stars like Yasiel Puig or Jose Abreu. Boston signed Rusney Castillo last year for $72.5 million over seven years. “They''ve shown that they''re ready to play in the major leagues, and that they can do it almost immediately,” said Junior Noboa, the Diamondbacks VP for Latin America. Next in line for a big bonus could be infielder Andy Ibanez, the youngest player for Cuba during the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Ibanez left the country illegally. Departing Cuba and signing a contract are but the first of many issues for players and their families. Starting ‘from zero’ “They have to start from zero, they have no idea what''s going on,” said Ariel Prieto, a 45-year old former Oakland Athletics pitcher hired by the Diamondbacks to mentor Tomas. “They know baseball, but they don''t know the different philosophy of U.S. teams.” Tomas said he passed on offers from Japanese teams, leaving behind his immediate family and a then 8-month-old daughter. He is focused on life''s new encounters: autograph seekers, income taxes, local traffic laws. The sport and its universal language help the transition - baseball, after all, is called “beisbol” in Spanish, a home run is a “jonron,” and a strike is, well, a “strike.” Away from the field, his thoughts drift home to Havana, where a flat-screen TV and new Chinese refrigerator are some of the perks his newfound riches have provided his family. Tomas thinks improved relations should make it easier for players to reunite with relatives. “It would be something good, beautiful, to be able to be with your family after so much time without seeing them,” Tomas said. His mother just wants to make sure he''s eating well and handling his unique opportunity properly. “I think he doesn''t know what that kind of money means,” she said. “Even I can''t imagine.”\n', 'Wed, 22 Apr 2015 18:19:59 -0400', '\nhttp://www.voanews.com/content/ap-us-cuba-major-league-baseball/2731063.html\n'),
(625, 'Concussions Settlement Could Cost NFL $1 Billion', '\nFormer players of the U.S. National Football League (NFL) suffering from years of hard hits to the head could each receive up to $5 million, after a federal judge in Philadelphia gave final approval to a settlement between the NFL and about 5,000 retired players. The deal that covers 65 years and could cost the NFL $1 billion was deemed by the judge to be "fair, reasonable and adequate." A ruling on the lawsuit filed by the players was made last July after the NFL agreed to remove a $675-million cap on damages for head injury claims, including brain damage and dementia. Wednesday''s agreement allows for monetary awards of various amounts depending on the number of seasons a player participated in the NFL, his age at diagnosis and other criteria. The average expected award is $190,000. The maximum payout for a player with Alzheimer''s was set at $3.5 million. More than $1 million can be awarded for former players in their 30s and 40s who suffer from Parkinson''s disease, Lou Gehrig''s disease, or for deaths involving chronic brain trauma. The NFL''s lead counsel said the decision "powerfully underscores the fairness and propriety of this historic settlement."
